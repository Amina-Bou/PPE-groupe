Glasgow cleansing strikes underway after council refuses “industrial
relations” reset

--

   Responding to the collapse of last ditch talks between GMB and Glasgow
   City Council tonight, resulting in strike action across the city’s
   cleansing service from 00.01 hours tomorrow, GMB Scotland Secretary
   Louise Gilmour said:

   “We met the council in good faith, offering a clear set of proposals to
   reset industrial relations and avoid strikes. The council rejected
   these proposals.

--

   “Regrettably, the council refused this massive opportunity to move
   forward and strike action across the cleansing service will now begin,
   during which time our members will be balloted on the COSLA pay
   offer.”
