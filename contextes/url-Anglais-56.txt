New styles of strikes and protest are emerging in the UK

   This article by Emma Sara Hughes, PhD Candidate in Employment
   Relations, at Bangor Business School and Tony Dundon, Professor of HRM
   & Employment Relations, University of Manchester was originally
   published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

   The image of strikers picketing outside factory gates is usually seen
   as something from the archives. Official statistics show an almost
   perennial decline in formal strikes. In the month of January 2018 there
   were 9,000 recorded working days lost due to strikes – a tiny fraction
   of the 3m recorded in January 1979.

   Yet there has been a noticeable increase in private sector working days
   lost from strike action. In January 2018, the figure stood at 231,000
   working days lost. That is 146,000 more days than in January 2017 and
   166,000 more than than January 2016.

   absenteeism, minor acts of defiance, mischief or sabotage. The Centre
   of Economic and Business consultancy reports year-on-year increases in
   absenteeism since 2011. Short disputes and other types of protest are
   excluded from official strike statistics – hence, many go unnoticed.

   Newer patterns of resistance include social media campaigns over

   Another reason may be because real wages have plummeted, while
   unemployment is at its lowest since the peak of strike activity in the
   mid-1970s (now 4.3%), thereby giving workers a greater degree of
   confidence in pressing their demands.

   Another possible explanation is that people now expect more and want
   immediate change. This is exemplified in shock votes for Donald Trump
   in the US, Brexit or even Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity.

   A new moral consciousness may even have replaced a former industrial

   People are not satisfied with this status quo and are calling for
   change. So, as well as the more traditional style of organised action,
   some workers are expressing this new potential moral consciousness with
   subtle active protest such as the lunchtime protests, worker sit-ins
