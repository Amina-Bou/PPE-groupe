   The 2016 junior doctors strikes in England had a ‘significant’ impact
   on the provision of healthcare, with thousands of appointments
   cancelled.

   Health at Imperial, said: “Our research showed that the junior doctors’
   industrial action had a significant impact on care. As a result of the
   strike there were over 100,000 outpatient appointment cancellations and
   more than 25,000 fewer planned admissions than expected.”

   The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, showed there was no
   obvious change in the death rate during any of the strikes.

   In the first four months of 2016, junior doctors from all specialties
   across England went on strike in protest against contractual changes
   brought in by the government. Before these strikes there had been only
   one other strike in the previous 40 years, in 2012.

   Each of the four strikes lasted 24–48 hours: 12 January; 10 February;
   9-10 March; and 26-27 April. This last was the only strike that
   included withdrawal of emergency care.

   The researchers, who were funded by the National Institute for Health
   Research, therefore compared hospital activity the week of each of the
   strikes with that from the preceding and following weeks. They focused
   on numbers of admissions, outpatient appointments, and A&E attendances.

   million outpatient appointments, and 3.4 million A&E attendances.

   Compared with the weeks preceding and following the strikes, there were
   over 9% (31,651) fewer admissions, nearly 7% (23,895) fewer A&E
   attendances, and 6% (173,462) fewer outpatient appointments than
   expected.

   April’s strike had the largest impact on services: there were over 15%
   (18,194) fewer admissions, including nearly 8% (3383) fewer emergency
   admissions, and almost 20% fewer planned admissions.

   Hospitals scheduled 11% (109,915) fewer outpatient appointments during
   this strike, while patients kept 134,711 (just over 17%) fewer of them.
   The number of outpatient appointments cancelled by hospitals also rose
   by almost 67% (43,823).

   During all four strikes, hospitals cancelled nearly 300,000 outpatient
   appointments – 52% higher than the volume expected for this period –
   possibly to protect more critical services, suggest the researchers.

   The number of recorded deaths didn’t change significantly during the
   strikes and wasn’t higher than expected, due to relatively small
   numbers. But hospital mortality is likely to be the least sensitive
   outcome for quality and safety concerns in this context, the

   They accept that they didn’t assess the impact of the strikes on
   patients who didn’t attend A&E, or the potential impact on the
   so-called ‘weekend effect,’ or how patients felt about their delayed
