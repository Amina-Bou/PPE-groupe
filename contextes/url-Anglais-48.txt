   halt in work production leverages a demand to enforce workers’ rights.
   Despite this, the UK does not recognise the legal right to withdraw
   labour. Instead, the UK’s “right to strike” is said to depend on a
   complex statutory scheme[2].

   This article will analyse a variety of sources, “statutes such as
   TULRCA 1992, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law[3]”, to determine whether the UK’s “right to strike” “is a classic
   instance of a ‘legislated’ right[4]” or if it is merely a “slogan/legal
   metaphor[5]”.

   ‘In truth, the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme. Even in jurisdictions where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document, such a
   complex right must be operationalised through labour statutes. It is a
   classic instance of a “legislated” right. Since the enactment of the
   Human Rights Act, and the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR, UK law
   may now be described as protecting a right to strike albeit one that is
   pieced together from a variety of sources: statutes such as TULRCA, the
   common law, Convention rights, and relevant case law.’[1]

   Does this statement accurately encapsulate the UK law on the ‘right to
   strike’? How do the different sources of law interact and what factors
   determine the correct balance to be reached between competing interests
   in regulating industrial action? Use case law, statute, legal
--
   affect innocent third parties (i.e. the general public).^[6] Therefore,
   in order to appease and ‘bring the labour under control’, the capital
   would ‘have to make concessions [i.e. comply with the strikers’ new
   terms], which provoke crises of profitability’.[7] However, the loss
   suffered by a business^[8] during and after industrial action is
   justified on two persuasive grounds. The first ground identified by
   Gwyneth Pitt is the human right aspect.^[9] To restrict the right to
   strike would be akin to the horrific period of slavery,^[10] where man
   had no power to withdraw his labour. This justification is recognising
   the inequalities in bargaining power between employer and
--
   of withdrawal of labour is the equilibrium argument. The power of the
   employer and their actions can only be matched and questioned by a
   ‘concerted stoppage of work’.^[14] Essentially, the right to strike is
   more than the withdrawal of labour: it is also the encompassing ‘right
   to free expression, association, assembly and power’.^[15] Yet there is
   ‘no positive legal right to strike in the UK’.^[16]

   Instead, ‘the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme’.^[17] In contrast to its neighbouring
   European countries’ (Spain and Italy) jurisdictions ‘where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document’, the UK law
   ‘protects a right to strike … from a variety of sources: statutes such
   as TULRCA, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law’.^[18] The accuracy of Bogg and Dukes’ encapsulation of the UK law
   on the ‘right to strike’ and how the different sources of law interact
   will be subsequently discussed.

   Judiciary

   While Spain^[19] and Italy^[20] protect the right to strike by
   suspending the contract of employment during industrial action, this
   contract is broken under English law.^[21] This is because the English
   common law does not confer a right to strike,^[22] hence ‘the rigour of
   the common law applies in the form of a breach of contract on part of
   the strikers and economic torts … [for] the organisers and their
   union’.^[23]

--
   its torts^[42] to protect ‘already powerful organisations’.^[43] Hence,
   from the perspective of trade unions and their members, the common
   law’s (inadequate) protection for the ‘right to strike’ has been,
   undeniably, very disappointing.

--
   Railway Co successfully sued the Amalgamated Society of Railway
   Servants union for £42,000.^[45] This sum is equivalent to
   £5,196,328.39 today. This verdict, in effect, eliminated ‘the strike as
   a weapon of organized labour’.[46] Naturally, workers turned to
   political parties for redress. The concern and advocacy for trade union
--
   economists, such as FA Hayek, viewed trade unions as an obstacle to
   economic growth.^[56] This perception was heightened by the Winter of
   Discontent (1978-79): a period characterised by widespread of strikes
   in response to the Labour government’s wage cap (to maintain falling
   inflation).^[57] Subsequently, Thatcher’s government further justified
--
   democracy, rights, and freedom of trade union members; ‘too often in
   recent years it has seemed that employees have been called out on
   strike by their unions without proper consultation and sometimes
   against their express wishes’.^[60] Accordingly, the Thatcher
   government introduced legislation that prior Conservative governments
--
   services’,^[66] 40% of all members entitled to vote must have voted in
   support of the industrial action. These stringent procedural
   requirements have to be strictly followed for a strike to be
   lawful.^[67] Oddly, there was no pressing need to introduce these
   restrictive measures.^[68] There were no significant problems in
   industrial relations at the time (ie, Winter of Discontent) nor any
   significant ‘pressure from business for further laws on strikes’,^[69]
   but the Conservative government justified these 2016 measures through
   the findings of Bruce Carr QC and Ed Holmes.^[70] The Government
--
   questioned the necessity of protecting industrial action by reflecting
   on the development of employment tribunals and discussing the economic
   consequences of strikes. The same ‘free-market economic theory’ that
   underpinned the MIR’s recommendations ‘drove’ the pragmatically
   restrictive and economically influenced 2016 statute developments.^[74]
--
   developed a three-part test to examine the legality of industrial
   action. This test encapsulates the substantive and procedural
   requirements for a lawful strike whilst observing the intertwined and
   ‘uneasy’ relationship between the common law and statute.^[82] If the
   industrial action is unlawful at common law, the judiciary asks whether
--
   the statutory rules’^[86]; there is a series of High Court instances of
   injunctions being granted to ‘ever more powerful and well-resourced
   employers’^[87] owing to invalid strike ballots.^[88] The readily
   available labour injunctions continued to be the “key piece^[89]” of
   suppressing collective action until the minor development in 2011.
--
   indicated a change in emphasis rather than substance’^[96] (since
   unions are still burdened with the challenges of exercising a ‘lawful’
   strike),^[97] this judgment enhanced union’s ability to resist
   injunction applications (as observed by Balfour Beatty Engineering
   Services Limited v Unite the Union).^[98] The unbiased interpretation
--
   The ECtHR confirmed, in Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey,^[100] that
   Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights included
   protection of the right to strike. This Article, and Article 6 of the
   European Social Charter^[101] bestow the right to strike for their
   member states members and due to the UK Human Rights Act 1998, ‘British
   workers are understood to enjoy a right to strike’.^[102] This, unlike
   the mere domestic statutory immunities, is the only instance of a
   ‘legislated’ right to strike in the UK.^[103]

   Under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, ‘statutory provisions
--
   be the leading precedent on the UK’s provisions of Article 11,^[107]
   despite the RMT and ASLEF judgment. In RMT and ASLEF, the UK courts
   acknowledged the ‘clearly protected’^[108] right to strike under ECHR
   Article 11. However, the court emphasised the importance of a ‘fair
   balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual
--
   ECtHR (and Human Rights Act 1998) in ‘controversial’ matters such as
   industrial action. This review has the powerful ability to eliminate
   the only instance of a legislated right to strike in the UK.^[125]


--
   ‘The notion of lawful industrial action is restrictive’, the procedural
   requirements are ‘onerous’ and the consequences of unions liability for
   unlawful strikes are ‘serious’.^[126] Nearly two decades after the
   European Social Charter’s review,^[127] the UK still does not guarantee
   the right to strike. The precedent in Metrobus still stands. There
   continues to be a ‘poorly reasoned and barely consistent’ series of
   judgments ‘by what looks like a weak, timid’^[128] and politically
   influenced^[129] judiciary. The enactment of the ‘Human Rights Act and
   the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR’^[130] will not prescribe a
   right to strike in the UK until the Supreme Court or ECtHR rule UK’s
   current provisions as incompatible with Article 11.

   In truth, ‘the right to strike [in the UK] has never been much more
   than a slogan or a legal metaphor’.^[131] This ‘slogan’ is a regime of
   immunities that are purposely designed upon an overly complex and
--
   injunctions, and unfair dismissals.^[134] This system was successfully
   underlined with the political agenda of deterring trade disputes; the
   UK’s worker strike total has fallen to its ‘lowest level since
   1893’.^[135]  The ‘unanimous and hostile’^[136] approach of the
   legislature and the judiciary towards industrial action exhibits the
