   LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer goods group Unilever Plc/NV has agreed on
   Friday to talks with British trade union leaders to try and resolve a
   dispute over pensions which led to a series of strikes at its UK plants
   over the last two months.

   British workers walked out on strike after Unilever moved to axe its
   final salary pension scheme, a move that will hit pensions for 5,000 of
   the group’s 7,000 UK employees. The strike action is the first in
   Britain in the group’s 82-year history.

   Around a third of Unilever’s British workforce are union members and
   were involved in a one-day strike in December, and then in 11 days of
   rolling strikes across the group’s 12 UK plants and offices during
   January.
