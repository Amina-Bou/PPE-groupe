   almost devoid of activity, with few goods coming in or out. For the
   first time in more than three decades, its workers were on strike.

   The walkout escalated the workers’ eight-month pay dispute with the
   port and CK Hutchison, its Hong Kong-based parent company. But it is
   just one of dozens of strikes that have swept Britain this summer, with
   more probably coming in the months ahead.

   In response to the strike, Hutchison Ports, a unit of CK Hutchison, has
   said it provides well-paid secure jobs and maintains that it is
   offering an increase in pay that is near the union’s demands. The
   company has also accused Unite of “promoting a national agenda” that is
   leaving its workers worse off. Logistics UK, a trade group, said
   disruption from the strike was minimal, as companies were able to move
   supplies in advance and Felixstowe tends not to be used for “just in
   time” supply chains.

   The rail strikes this summer — the largest in three decades — brought
   much of Britain to a standstill, which could have ignited fury across

   With so many vital public services being disrupted, bleak comparisons
   have been made to the late 1970s and Britain’s infamous Winter of
   Discontent. More than a million workers in 1979 went on strike to
   protest the government’s attempt to impose a public-sector pay ceiling
   to try to control soaring inflation. Trash piled up, schools closed,

   Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union,
   believes today’s unrest will last longer than a wave of summertime
   strikes. “This is also signaling a complete break from the traditional
   ways that companies are being run,” he said. “And it’s potentially
   filling the vacuum that exists politically.”

   Many of the issues at the heart of these strikes, such as the
   privatization of public services and weak pay growth, are long-running.
   But the spur to action may have been the pandemic lockdowns, which

   The Ministry of Justice has called the strike “irresponsible.” Still,
   the issue will be in the in-tray of the next justice minister, and
