   Almost half of all UK adults support rail workers going on strike when

   Commenting on the poll, political research director at Savanta ComRes
   Chris Hopkins said: “This so-called ‘summer of strikes’ is far from
   over, and providing unions can get the message across to the public

   “Contrarily, though, the public do believe that continued industrial
   action will have a negative impact on sympathy levels for the sectors

   The poll comes amid a series of further strike days being taken this
   week. Rail workers are striking today and Saturday while TfL staff will
   walk out on Friday.

   Royal Mail employees are due to take further strike action.
   Communication Workers Union general secretary Dave Ward said last week
   that workers were being “mugged off” by the Royal Mail Group after the
   union announced that 115,000 postal staff will take four days of strike
   action in the coming weeks.
