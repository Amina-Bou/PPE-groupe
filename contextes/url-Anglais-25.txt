Public sector strikes hit schools and services around the UK

   10 July 2014
--

   Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in rallies and marches
   across the UK as part of a day of strike action by public service
   unions.

   Teachers, firefighters and council workers joined the strike, which
   follows disputes with the government over pay, pensions and cuts.

   But Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady said
   workers had gone on strike "to say enough is enough".

   The GMB and Unison unions said more than one million people had taken
   part in the strikes.

   But Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said fewer than 500,000 had

   The government also said one fifth of civil servants - fewer than
   90,000 workers - had been on strike and that 717 Jobcentres had been
   unaffected.

   Those who have taken part in the action include:
     * Firefighters, who are on strike between 10:00 and 19:00 BST in a
       row over pensions and retirement age
     * The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) - which represents

       and teaching staff - who also dismissed the "insulting" pay offer
     * The National Union of Teachers (NUT), whose general secretary
       Christine Blower said teachers "deeply regretted" taking strike
       action
     * Schools, courts, job centres and council services have been hit in
       Wales, where around 70,000 public sector workers are on strike
     * Members of the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, who work
       in a range of areas including housing, youth justice and libraries,

       and pensions

   For Unite, Unison and the GMB, the strike action covers workers in
   England, Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland, while the PCS
   covers all four nations. The FBU and NUT have been striking in England

   Ed Miliband: "Nobody wants to see these strikes...they are always a
   sign of failure"

   Labour leader Ed Miliband told the BBC the government should bear the
   responsibility for the strikes, which represented a "failure on all
   sides".

   TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Across the public sector
   workers are on strike today to say enough is enough.

   "Year after year pay has failed to keep up with the cost of living."

   BBC political correspondent Norman Smith

   Strikes are meant to cause maximum pain for employers but in this case
   it doesn't look like this is happening.

   Why? Because far from causing the government much political grief,
   today's strikes by public sector workers are actually rather
   politically convenient.

--

   In particular, Prime Minister David Cameron is keen to include plans
   for a strike ballot threshold in his party's next manifesto.

   Today's strikes enable ministers to turn up the heat on Labour by
   pressing them to condemn the industrial action being carried out by
   their big union supporters.

   bullish stance.

   So, while in public ministers will appear angered by the strikes, in
   private they may be a good deal more relaxed.

Ballot turnouts

   The strikes went ahead despite the government arguing they are based on
   ballots conducted some years ago, with low turnout from union members.

--

   On Wednesday, Mr Cameron said the time had come for legislation setting
   a minimum turnout for a strike ballot, promising this in the next
   Conservative manifesto.

   Under the current law, a strike can take place if it is backed by a
   simple majority of those union members who vote - regardless of the
   level of turnout.

   I'm not sure it will be the next Christmas number one but this was the
   song blasting out of speakers in Birmingham's Victoria Square and the
   union members out on strike loved it. They cheered, sang along and
   waved their flags.

--

   Of course these union members weren't the only ones off work today.
   Parents with children at schools affected by the strikes were also left
   with no option but to juggle childcare.

   It says today's action was disruptive and says it will consider looking
   at introducing tougher anti-strike laws. The government says the case
   for reforms is gathering pace in the face of ballots with low levels of
   support.
