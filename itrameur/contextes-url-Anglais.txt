Trade unions vow to fight government over strike legislation to 'keep Britain
moving' during strikes

This year has been plagued by travel chaos, caused by months of industrial
--

   The government is pressing ahead to introduce legislation which will
   require transport workers to run a minimum service when strikes are
   taking place.

--

   But trade unions have insisted the proposals will undermine workers'
   right to strike and have promised to defend their members.

   Liz Truss is aiming to ensure transport services, including rail, tubes
   and buses, cannot be completely shutdown when workers go on strike.

   "The government stood on a manifesto commitment to introduce minimum
   service levels. As we have seen only too often in recent months, it is
   wrong that strikes are preventing hard-working people and families up
   and down the country from getting to work, doctors' appointments and
   school," a government source said.

What is happening to the right to strike?


   We've heard a lot about strikes in the media this year, as the
   government passed their Trade Union Act in May. And much of the
   coverage has portrayed ordinary working people with genuine grievances
--
   businesses to their knees.

   The truth is less dramatic. People only ever go on strike as an
   absolute last resort. Strikes happen where workers feel strongly that
   they are still being unfairly treated and not listened to – strongly
   enough to go without pay while on strike, and put themselves through
   what is often a stressful experience.

   Under UK employment law, workers have the right not to be dismissed or
   suffer detriment for going on strike, providing some pretty stringent
   conditions are met. Nevertheless, the government wrote its assault on
   strikes into law with the Trade Union Act, which puts even tighter
   limits on what now constitutes legitimate industrial action and, in the
   words of TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady, “attacks the right to
   strike – a fundamental British liberty. It poses a serious threat to
   good industrial relations and is completely unnecessary.”

   It hasn't yet been implemented, but the Act's provisions will include
   minimum turnouts for strike votes (hard to reach as unions are also
   banned from using online or workplace voting systems), tighter time
   limits on mandates for strikes, restrictions on
   picketing and bureacratic changes which will give employers chances to
   use the courts to stop strikes. Workers will still technically have
   a right to strike, but the Act makes the right much harder to access.

The real story of industrial action today

   Just how unnecessary this new Act is is borne out by the latest stats
   on strike action:
     * Less than 3 in 100,000 working days were lost to strike action in
       2015
     * 81,000 people went on strike last year – the lowest number since
       records began
     * Only 106 strikes took place in 2015 – that’s twenty times fewer
       than in 1975!
     * Strikes are very rare and seldom last longer than three days
--
   piece of legislation.

   Attacks on the basic right to strike are attacks on the ability of
   ordinary workers to successfully negotiate fair pay, conditions and
   practices. Like Deliveroo’s couriers and workers at this London cinema.

The London Tube strike 'brought economic benefits for workers'

   PolicyResearch

   New analysis of the London Tube strike in February 2014 finds that it
   enabled a sizeable fraction of commuters to find better routes to work,
   and actually produced a net economic benefit due to the number of
--
   Cambridge analysed 20 days’ worth of anonymised Oyster card data,
   containing more than 200 million data points, in order to see how
   individual Tube journeys changed during the strike. Since this
   particular strike only resulted in a partial closure of the Tube
   network and not all commuters were affected by the strike, a direct
   comparison was possible. The data enabled the researchers to see
   whether people chose to go back to their normal commute once the strike
   was over, or if they found a more efficient route and decided to
   switch.

    The researchers found that of the regular commuters affected by the
   strike, either because certain stations were closed or because travel
   times were considerably different, a significant fraction – about one
   in 20 – decided to stick with their new route once the strike was over.

    While the proportion of individuals who ended up changing their routes
   may sound small, the researchers found that the strike actually ended
   up producing a net economic benefit. By performing a cost-benefit
   analysis of the amount of time saved by those who changed their daily
   commute, the researchers found that the amount of time saved in the
   longer term actually outweighed the time lost by commuters during the
   strike.

    The London Tube map itself may have been a reason why many commuters
   did not find their optimal journey before the strike. In many parts of
   London, the actual distances between stations are distorted on the
   iconic map. By digitising the Tube map and comparing it to the actual
   distances between stations, the researchers found that those commuters
   living in, or travelling to, parts of London where distortion is
   greatest were more likely to have learned from the strike and found a
   more efficient route.  Additionally, since different Tube lines travel
   at different speeds, those commuters who had been travelling on one of
   the slower lines were also more likely to switch routes once the strike
   was over.

--

    According to the authors, being forced to alter a routine, whether
   that’s due to a Tube strike or government regulation, can often lead to
   net benefits, as people or corporations are forced to innovate. In
   economics, this is known as the Porter hypothesis.

   Almost half of all UK adults support rail workers going on strike when
   the dispute is over pay and conditions, according to research by
   Savanta ComRes.

   The polling, published this afternoon amid ongoing strikes as transport
   workers across the country take part in industrial action to protect
   their pay, terms and conditions, found strong support among the public
--

   Commenting on the poll, political research director at Savanta ComRes
   Chris Hopkins said: “This so-called ‘summer of strikes’ is far from
   over, and providing unions can get the message across to the public
   that the pay deals they’ve been offered are not satisfactory, public
--
   “Contrarily, though, the public do believe that continued industrial
   action will have a negative impact on sympathy levels for the sectors
   balloting for strike action, and therefore there could still be a
   tipping point where the public have simply had enough and support
   begins to fade away.”

   The poll comes amid a series of further strike days being taken this
   week. Rail workers are striking today and Saturday while TfL staff will
   walk out on Friday.

   Royal Mail employees are due to take further strike action.
   Communication Workers Union general secretary Dave Ward said last week
   that workers were being “mugged off” by the Royal Mail Group after the
   union announced that 115,000 postal staff will take four days of strike
   action in the coming weeks.

   Thousands of workers across a number of industries are taking, or

   Many unions say wages are not keeping pace with the rising cost of
   living and their members need a pay rise.

   So who's going on strike, when, and how will it affect you?

   Criminal barristers in England and Wales are taking part in an

   The strike ramped up in September. Before that, barristers were
   striking on alternate weeks and refused to carry out certain types of
   work.
--
   At the end of September, the government made a fresh offer with fee
   increases for legal aid work. Barristers will now be asked to vote on
   the proposals and whether to end the strike.

What are the rules for strikes?

     * A strike can only happen if a majority of union members agree to it
       via an organised vote, known as a ballot
     * If workers do decide to take industrial action, the employer must
       be given 14 days notice, unless otherwise agreed
     * Police officers are banned from taking strike action and nurses
       have an agreement that they should only walk out if it does not
       risk the wellbeing of patients
     * Workers on strike can expect to lose wages for the time they do not
       work

   cessation of work by a body of employees" is from 1810. Baseball sense
   is first recorded 1841, originally meaning any contact with the ball;
   modern sense developed by 1890s, apparently from foul strike, which

General strike

   Article Talk
--
     * Edit

   A general strike refers to a strike action in which participants cease
   all economic activity, such as working, to strengthen the bargaining
   position of a trade union or achieve a common social or political goal.
--
   organizations and may also include rallies, marches, boycotts, civil
   disobedience, non-payment of taxes, and other forms of direct or
   indirect action. Additionally, general strikes might exclude care
   workers, such as teachers, doctors, and nurses.

   Historically, the term general strike has referred primarily to
   solidarity action, which is a multi-sector strike that is organised by
   trade unions who strike together in order to force pressure on
   employers to begin negotiations or offer more favourable terms to the
   strikers; though not all strikers may have a material interest in the
   negotiations.

19th centuryEdit

   The general strike action only became a feature of the political
   landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first
   time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial

   The first theorist to formulate and popularise the idea of a general
   strike for the purpose of political reform was the radical pamphleteer
   William Benbow.^[1] Closely involved with planning the attempted
   Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817,^[2] he

   advocate direct and even violent action for political reform, in
   particular he advanced his idea for a "national holiday" and "national
   convention". By this he meant an extended period of general strike by
   the working classes, which would be a sacred or holy action (hence
   "holy-day"), during which time local committees would keep the peace
--
   In 1842 the demands for fairer wages and conditions across many
   different industries finally exploded into the first modern general
   strike (the 1842 general strike). After the second Chartist Petition
   was presented to Parliament in April 1842 and rejected, the strike
   began in the coal mines of Staffordshire, England, and soon spread
   through Britain affecting factories, mills in Lancashire and coal mines
   from Dundee to South Wales and Cornwall.^[6] Instead of being a
   spontaneous uprising of the mutinous masses, the strike was politically
   motivated and was driven by a hard-headed agenda to win concessions.
   Probably as much as half of the then industrial workforce were on
   strike at its peak—over 500,000 men. The local leadership marshaled a
   growing working-class tradition to politically organise their followers
   to mount an articulate challenge to the capitalist, political

   The mass abandonment of plantations by black slaves and poor whites
   during the American Civil War has, controversially, been considered a
   general strike. In his classic history Black Reconstruction in America,
   W. E. B. Du Bois describes this mass abandonment in precisely these
   terms:
--
     Transforming itself suddenly from a problem of abandoned plantations
     and slaves captured while being used by the [Southern] enemy for
     military purposes, the movement became a general strike against the
     slave system on the part of all who could find opportunity. The
     trickling streams of fugitives swelled to a flood. Once begun, the
     general strike of black and white went madly and relentlessly on
     like some great saga.^[7]

   The next large-scale general strike took place over half a century
   later in Belgium, in an effort to force the government to grant
   universal suffrage to the people.^[8] However, there were periodical
   strikes throughout the 19th century that could loosely be considered as
   'general strikes'. In the United States, the 1835 Philadelphia General
   Strike lasted for three weeks, after which the striking workers won
   their goal of a ten-hour workday and an increase in wages.^[9] Later
   general strikes include a one-week general strike of workers in the
   Central Pacific Railroad, a general strike that was not widely reported
   in the press or studied in literature because it was peaceful.,^[10]
   and the more violent and disruptive 1877 Saint Louis general strike,
   which grew out of the events of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877
   across the United States and the 1892 New Orleans general strike. The
   year of 1919 saw a cascade of general strikes around the world as a
   result of the political convulsions caused by the First World War—in
   Germany, Belfast, Seattle and Winnipeg.

   The 1905 general strike in Tampere, Grand Duchy of Finland

   The Russian Revolution of 1905 saw a massive wave of social unrest
   across the Russian Empire, characterised by large scale general strikes
   on the part of the industrial workers. The 1926 United Kingdom general
   strike started in the coal industry and rapidly escalated; the unions
   called out 1,750,000 workers, mainly in the transport and steel
   sectors, although the strike was successfully suppressed by the
   government.^[11]^[12]

   A General Strike or Solidarity Strike was when various trade unions
   would go on strike sympathetically to help another trade union. General
   strikes were a sort of "nuclear option" for trade unions to all band
   together and go on a prolonged strike together.

   Ralph Chaplin, editor of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
   newspaper Solidarity and later of the Industrial Worker, identified
   four levels of general strike. rising from a community, to an industry,
   to a nationwide strike, and finally a revolutionary or class
   strike.^[13]

   In a 1905 pamphlet, published in Chicago, Stephen Naft acknowledged the
   same four levels of the general strike:

     [The name "General Strike"] is often used to designate the strike of
     all branches in one trade; for instance the general strike of the
     miners; when helpers and hoisting engineers, etc. are all out. Then
     it is used as: General Strike of a city, i.e., "General Strike in

   existing sentiment for this goal of the general strike to proletarians
   of Spain and Italy.^[15]

     powerfully the working class organises itself, it still has no
     significant power over a congress, or the executive (which has
     military force at its beck and call). Therefore, a general strike

     be embraced by the mass of workers who remain unorganised. Thus it

   industrial process during any labour dispute.^[16] The pamphlet notes

   However, the pamphlet asserts that,

     The immense advantage of the general strike is that it begins
     entirely lawfully and without any danger for the workers, and for
     this reason thousands will take part...^[18]

   The year 1919 saw a number of general strikes throughout the United
   States and Canada, including two that were considered significant—the
   Seattle General Strike, and the Winnipeg General Strike. While the IWW
--
   In June 1919, the AFL national organisation, in session in Atlantic
   City, New Jersey, passed resolutions in opposition to the general
   strike. The official report of these proceedings described the
   convention as the "largest and in all probability the most important
   Convention ever held" by the organisation, in part for having
   engineered the "overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element"
   via crushing a "One Big Union proposition", and also for defeating a
   proposal for a nationwide general strike, both "by a vote of more than
   20 to 1."^[20] The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central
   labour union (i.e., regional labour councils) from "taking a strike
   vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union
   concerned".^[20] The change was intended to "check the spread of
   general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of what happened at
   Seattle and is now going on at Winnipeg."^[20] The penalty for any
   unauthorised strike vote was revocation of that body's charter.^[20]

   After the passage of the anti-union Taft–Hartley Act in 1947, the
   general strike changed from a tool of labor strike solidarity into a
   general form of social, political, and economic protest. Congress
   passed the law in the wake of the women-led 1946 Oakland General
   Strike. It outlawed actions taken by unionized workers in support of
   workers at other companies, effectively rendering both solidarity
   actions and the general strike itself illegal.^[21] Before 1947 and the
   passage of the Taft-Hartley Act the term general strike meant when
   various unions would officially go on strike in solidarity with other
   striking unions. The act made it illegal for one union to go on strike
   to support another. Hence, the definition and practice of a general
   strike changed in modern times to mean periodic days of mass action
   coordinated, often, by unions, but not an official or prolonged strike.

   Since then, in the US and Europe the general strike has become a tool
   of mass economic protest often in conjunction with other forms of
   electoral action and direct civil action.

   Debates on general strikesEdit

Socialists versus anarchistsEdit
--
   and early 20th century anarchists from socialists: electoral politics,
   which the socialists embraced, but anarchists generally opposed; and,
   the general strike as a mechanism to prevent war, which anarchists
   supported, but socialists refused to endorse.^[22]

   As a group, the socialists of the period repeatedly rejected the
   general strike as a tactic;^[23] however, a number of socialist leaders
   advocated its use for one reason or another.^[24] Socialist leaders who
   embraced the general strike tended to see it as an instrument for
   obtaining political concessions.^[23]

   Drachkovitch identified five types of general strikes:
     * the political mass strike, a general strike for political rights
       (such as the right to vote)
     * the general strike as a revolutionary act that would transform
       society
     * the general strike as a "revolutionary exercise" which would
       eventually lead to a transformation of society
     * a one-day demonstration general strike on May Day (International
       Workers' Day), aimed at identifying a "worldwide proletariat"
     * commencing in 1891, a theoretical mechanism by which to stop wars
--

   Drachkovitch perceived the first two concepts, the socialist-friendly
   general strike for political rights within the system, and the general
   strike as a revolutionary mechanism to overthrow the existing
   order—which he associated with a "rising anarcho-syndicalist
   movement"—as mutually exclusive.^[26] Drachkovitch believed that the
   difficulty arose from the fact that the general strike was "one
   instrument", but was frequently considered "without distinction of
   underlying motives."^[27]

   Milorad M. Drachkovitch also observed the variable success of the
   general strike in actual use:

     In Belgium a general strike movement, broken off in one instance
     without damage to the organizing forces, eventually led to universal
     suffrage; in Holland a general strike collapsed with disastrous
     consequences; in Sweden, a general strike was conducted and
     terminated with disciplined order but did not attain the desired
     results. In Italy, general strikes had been both socially effective
     and politically unproductive. On the other hand, the events of
     January 1905 in Russia once more seemed to underscore the
     suitability of the general strike as a decisively revolutionary
     action.^[27]

Syndicalism and general strikesEdit

   The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) began to fully embrace the
   general strike in 1910–1911.^[28] The ultimate goal of the general
   strike, according to Industrial Workers of the World theory, is to
   displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to
   workers.^[28]^[29] In a 1911 speech in New York City, IWW organiser
   Bill Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he
   believed a general strike was justified,

     The capitalists have wealth; they have money. They invest the money
--
     a mine, a railroad, a mill. They will keep that factory running just
     as long as there are profits coming in. When anything happens to
     disturb the profits, what do the capitalists do? They go on strike,
     don't they? They withdraw their finances from that particular mill.
     They close it down because there are no profits to be made there.
--

   Bill Haywood believed that industrial unionism made possible the
   general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial
   democracy.^[30] According to Wobbly theory, the conventional strike is
   an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and
   working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good
   training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle,
   and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for
   the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.^[31] During the final
   general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories,
   mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take
   them over.^[31] Prior to taking action to initiate industrial
--

   In 1927 the IWW called for a three-day nationwide walkout—in essence, a
   demonstration general strike—to protest the execution of anarchists
   Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.^[34] The most notable
   response to the call was in the Walsenburg coal district of Colorado,
   where 1,132 miners stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work,^[35] a
   participation rate which led directly to the Colorado coal strike of
   1927.

   On 18 March 2011, the Industrial Workers of the World supported an
   endorsement of a general strike as a follow-up to protests against
   Governor Scott Walker's proposed labour legislation in Wisconsin,
   following a motion passed by the South Central Federation of Labor
   (SCFL) of Wisconsin endorsing a statewide general strike as a response
   to those legislative proposals.^[36]^[37] The SCFL website states,

     At SCFL’s monthly meeting Monday, Feb. 21, delegates endorsed the
     following: "The SCFL endorses a general strike, possibly for the day
     Walker signs his 'budget repair bill.'" An ad hoc committee was
     formed to explore the details. SCFL did not CALL for a general
     strike because it does not have that authority.^[37]

   On 26 November 2020, a nationwide general strike of 250 million people,
   as per trade unions claim, took place in support of Indian farmers'
   protests.^[38]

   The largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced
   industrial country—and the first general wildcat strike in history—was
   May 1968 in France.^[39] The prolonged strike involved eleven million
   workers for two weeks in a row,^[39] and its impact was such that it
   almost caused the collapse of the de Gaulle government. Other notable
   general strikes include:

     * In Portugal, a general strike was called in 2011 by the federation
       of public labour unions to avert austerity measures.^[40]
     * In Honduras, a general strike was called in 2011 by union workers,
       farmers and other organisations demanding better education, an
       increase in the minimum wage and against fuel price hikes.^[41]
     * In Yemen, thousands of people took the streets in a general strike
       in 2011 to protest President Ali Abdullah Saleh.^[42]
     * In Algeria, public sector workers in 2011 mounted a general strike
       for higher wages and improved working conditions.^[43]
     * In February 1947, General Douglas MacArthur, as Supreme Commander
       of the Allied Powers in Japan, banned a planned general strike of
       2,400,000 government workers, stating that "so deadly a social
       weapon" as a general strike should not be used in the impoverished
       and emaciated condition of Japan so soon after World War II.
       Japan's labour leaders complied with his ban.^[44]

       halted all transportation.^[45]

Support for striking workers declared by 600 Labour councillors

   Exclusive: Open letter puts pressure on party’s stance on strikes amid

   More than 600 Labour councillors have declared their full backing for
   all rail, postal, dock and other workers on picket lines, as the party
   comes under continuing pressure over its stance on strikes.

   Amid a wave of strikes over pay and increasing talk of coordinated
   industrial action this autumn, the councillors signed an open letter
   saying they offered “full solidarity and support” to the Rail, Maritime

   (CWU), Unite and others.

   The latest workers to go on strike are CWU postal workers who rejected
   a 5.5% pay rise in return for changes to their conditions, while the
   RMT is planning a further round of rail strikes in the autumn. There
   are also 1,900 dockworker members of Unite at Felixstowe, the country’s
   biggest port, on an eight-day stoppage.

   However, the issue of strikes is a vexed one for Labour. Keir Starmer,
   the party’s leader, has expressed sympathy with the aims of striking
   workers, but the party’s whips have asked frontbenchers not to appear

Legal challenge against ‘strike-breaking’ law

   Eleven trade unions, coordinated by the TUC have begun legal
   proceedings to protect the right to strike. The unions – ASLEF, BFAWU,
   FDA, GMB, NEU, NUJ, POA, PCS, RMT, Unite and Usdaw – have taken the
   case against the government’s new regulations which allow agency
   workers to fill in for striking workers and break strikes. TUC
   affiliated unions UNISON and NASUWT are also launching separate
   individual legal cases against the government’s agency worker
   regulations. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The right to
   strike is a fundamental British liberty. But the government is
   attacking it in broad daylight.” She added: “Ministers failed to
   consult with unions, as the law requires. And restricting the freedom
   to strike is a breach of international law. That’s why unions are
   coming together to challenge this change in the courts.” The TUC has
   also made a complaint to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
