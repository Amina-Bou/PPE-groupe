The London Tube strike 'brought economic benefits for workers'

   PolicyResearch

   New analysis of the London Tube strike in February 2014 finds that it
   enabled a sizeable fraction of commuters to find better routes to work,
   and actually produced a net economic benefit due to the number of
--
   Cambridge analysed 20 days’ worth of anonymised Oyster card data,
   containing more than 200 million data points, in order to see how
   individual Tube journeys changed during the strike. Since this
   particular strike only resulted in a partial closure of the Tube
   network and not all commuters were affected by the strike, a direct
   comparison was possible. The data enabled the researchers to see
   whether people chose to go back to their normal commute once the strike
   was over, or if they found a more efficient route and decided to
   switch.

    The researchers found that of the regular commuters affected by the
   strike, either because certain stations were closed or because travel
   times were considerably different, a significant fraction – about one
   in 20 – decided to stick with their new route once the strike was over.

    While the proportion of individuals who ended up changing their routes
   may sound small, the researchers found that the strike actually ended
   up producing a net economic benefit. By performing a cost-benefit
   analysis of the amount of time saved by those who changed their daily
   commute, the researchers found that the amount of time saved in the
   longer term actually outweighed the time lost by commuters during the
   strike.

    The London Tube map itself may have been a reason why many commuters
   did not find their optimal journey before the strike. In many parts of
   London, the actual distances between stations are distorted on the
   iconic map. By digitising the Tube map and comparing it to the actual
   distances between stations, the researchers found that those commuters
   living in, or travelling to, parts of London where distortion is
   greatest were more likely to have learned from the strike and found a
   more efficient route.  Additionally, since different Tube lines travel
   at different speeds, those commuters who had been travelling on one of
   the slower lines were also more likely to switch routes once the strike
   was over.

--

    According to the authors, being forced to alter a routine, whether
   that’s due to a Tube strike or government regulation, can often lead to
   net benefits, as people or corporations are forced to innovate. In
   economics, this is known as the Porter hypothesis.

   Almost half of all UK adults support rail workers going on strike when
   the dispute is over pay and conditions, according to research by
   Savanta ComRes.

   The polling, published this afternoon amid ongoing strikes as transport
   workers across the country take part in industrial action to protect
   their pay, terms and conditions, found strong support among the public
--

   Commenting on the poll, political research director at Savanta ComRes
   Chris Hopkins said: “This so-called ‘summer of strikes’ is far from
   over, and providing unions can get the message across to the public
   that the pay deals they’ve been offered are not satisfactory, public
--
   “Contrarily, though, the public do believe that continued industrial
   action will have a negative impact on sympathy levels for the sectors
   balloting for strike action, and therefore there could still be a
   tipping point where the public have simply had enough and support
   begins to fade away.”

   The poll comes amid a series of further strike days being taken this
   week. Rail workers are striking today and Saturday while TfL staff will
   walk out on Friday.

   Royal Mail employees are due to take further strike action.
   Communication Workers Union general secretary Dave Ward said last week
   that workers were being “mugged off” by the Royal Mail Group after the
   union announced that 115,000 postal staff will take four days of strike
   action in the coming weeks.

   Commuters at rush hour during a strike on Thursday

   Thousands of workers across a number of industries are taking, or
   considering, strike action.

   Many unions say wages are not keeping pace with the rising cost of
   living and their members need a pay rise.

   So who's going on strike, when, and how will it affect you?

   No more strike dates have currently been set, but more strikes are very
   likely, says union boss Mick Lynch after a summer of disrupted travel
   for passengers. Unions have to give two weeks' notice of any walkout.

   Strikes in recent weeks left only 20% of trains running on some days
   and no services in parts of the country - hitting commuters and people
   travelling to big events such as the Commonwealth Games.

   Criminal barristers in England and Wales are taking part in an

   The strike ramped up in September. Before that, barristers were
   striking on alternate weeks and refused to carry out certain types of
   work.
--
   At the end of September, the government made a fresh offer with fee
   increases for legal aid work. Barristers will now be asked to vote on
   the proposals and whether to end the strike.

What are the rules for strikes?

     * A strike can only happen if a majority of union members agree to it
       via an organised vote, known as a ballot
     * If workers do decide to take industrial action, the employer must
       be given 14 days notice, unless otherwise agreed
     * Police officers are banned from taking strike action and nurses
       have an agreement that they should only walk out if it does not
       risk the wellbeing of patients
     * Workers on strike can expect to lose wages for the time they do not
       work
     * People can choose to continue working during a strike

--
   is from mid-14c.; that of "to hit with a missile" is from late 14c.
   Meaning "to cancel or expunge" (as with the stroke of a pen) is
   attested from late 14c. A Middle English sense is preserved in strike
   for "go toward." Sense of "come upon, find" is from 1835 (especially in
   mining, well-digging, etc., hence strike it rich, 1854). Baseball sense

   cessation of work by a body of employees" is from 1810. Baseball sense
   is first recorded 1841, originally meaning any contact with the ball;
   modern sense developed by 1890s, apparently from foul strike, which

   against the batter; figurative sense of have two strikes against (of a
   possible three) is from 1938. Bowling sense attested from 1859. Meaning
   "sudden military attack" is attested from 1942.

   Why Strike?
    1. The ability to strike is a fundamental part of the right organize
       and collectively bargain recognized in Canada. On June 14, 2017,
       Canada ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining
       Convention, 1949 (No. 98).
    2.  It is legal. The Supreme Court of Canada recognizes the
       constitutional right to strike for Canadian workers in a 2015
       decision. The right to strike is constitutionally protected under
       the freedom of association in section 2(d) of the Canadian Charter
       of Rights and Freedoms.
--
       the complete mercy of employers. One of their objectives is to
       change the balance of power between workers and employer.
    4.  Most strikes are about pay and better working conditions. Without
       the threat of strike action, corporations will be able to make
       bigger profits, while working conditions will get worse.
    5. Strike is part of their bargaining tool. Striking is sometimes
       their last legal option.

Rail strikes: Passengers warned not to travel by train next week

     * By Michael Race
--

   Train passengers are to be told to only travel next week if it is
   absolutely necessary, even if rail worker strikes are called off at the
   last minute.

--
   Network Rail over pay, jobs and conditions.

   Disruption will be inevitable even if strikes are aborted because of
   how long it takes to restore a normal timetable.

--

   Network Rail, which owns and maintains Britain's railway
   infrastructure, said 50% of the railways will be shut down on strike
   days, regardless of whether the walkouts go ahead.

--
   GMT, it added.

   Delays and cancellations are also expected on non-strike days during
   the week, because trains will be in the wrong places and staff shift
   patterns mean it takes time for all workers to return to work.
     * When are the next train strikes?

   The RMT has staged a series of strikes since the summer involving about
   40,000 rail workers employed by Network Rail and 14 train companies.

   Further action is planned with Network Rail workers set to strike from
   18:30 on Christmas Eve until 27 December.

   They will then be joined by workers at the train companies for strikes
   on 3-4 January and 6-7 January.

   Businesses, particularly those in hospitality, have raised concerns
   over the impact of the strikes during the busy festive period, with
   industry experts suggesting more than £1.5bn of trade could be lost.

   Several meetings between unions bosses, train companies and Network
   Rail have so far failed to prevent strikes on the railways, which have
   been happening on and off for months.

   As things stand, next week's strikes will go ahead.

   Even if they are cancelled, significant disruption now looks

   timetable.

   As with previous national RMT strikes, very few trains will run and
   some places will have none at all. A key reason is the involvement of
   Network Rail's signalling staff across Britain.
--

   But we won't know the result of that electronic referendum until Monday
   afternoon, the eve of the first 48-hour strike.

   Even if the deal was accepted (against the recommendation of the RMT),
   it would be too late to reinstate normal services on Tuesday.

   The rail industry is not the only sector facing strike action, with
   postal workers, bus drivers, teachers and nurses all set to walk out
   this month. Ambulance staff across many parts of England and Wales are
   also set to strike on 21 and 28 December.

   Workers are demanding better conditions and pay rises that match

   RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has said he regrets the inconvenience
   caused by the strikes but added that the government is ultimately to
   blame. "They are running the playbook and the strategy for the railway
   companies and directing what's going on," he said.

Biggest ever university strikes set to hit UK campuses over pay, conditions &amp;
pensions

   8 November 2022

   Over 70,000 university staff at 150 universities will strike for three
   days later this month over attacks on pay, working conditions and
   pensions. The National Union of Students (NUS) has backed the strikes,
   which will be the biggest ever to hit UK universities and could impact
   2.5 million students.

   UCU said disruption can be avoided if employers act fast and make
   improved offers. If they don't, strike action will escalate in the New
   Year alongside a marking and assessment boycott.

   The full strike dates in November are:
     * Thursday 24 November
     * Friday 25 November
     * Wednesday 30 November.

   Staff will also begin industrial action short of strike action from
   Wednesday 23 November, which includes working to rule, refusing to make
   up work lost as a result of strike action and refusing to cover for
   absent colleagues.

   The strikes come after UCU members overwhelmingly voted 'yes'
   to industrial action last month in two historic national ballots over
   attacks on pay and working conditions as well as pension cuts. Despite
--

   UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: 'Campuses across the UK are about
   to experience strike action on a scale never seen before. 70,000 staff
   will walk out and make clear they refuse to accept falling pay, cuts to
   pensions and insecure employment.
--
   in surpluses whilst slashing staff pensions.

   'UCU members do not want to strike but are doing so to save the sector
   and win dignity at work. This dispute has the mass support of students
   because they know their learning conditions are our members' working
--

   'If university vice-chancellors don't get serious, our message is
   simple - this bout of strike action will be just the beginning.'

   NUS vice president higher education Chloe Field said: 'Students stand
   in solidarity with the 70,000 university staff across the UK who will
   strike later this month. Staff teaching conditions are students'
   learning conditions, and we must fight together for a fairer, healthier
   education system for everyone who works and studies.

   'This is the fifth year in a row that government cuts to education and
   workers' rights have resulted in strike action on our campuses. In that
   time, staff and students have stood together in the fight for better
   pay and conditions for all university staff, including the thousands of

Public sector strikes hit schools and services around the UK

   10 July 2014
--

   Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in rallies and marches
   across the UK as part of a day of strike action by public service
   unions.

   Teachers, firefighters and council workers joined the strike, which
   follows disputes with the government over pay, pensions and cuts.

--

   But Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady said
   workers had gone on strike "to say enough is enough".

   The GMB and Unison unions said more than one million people had taken
   part in the strikes.

   But Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said fewer than 500,000 had

   The government also said one fifth of civil servants - fewer than
   90,000 workers - had been on strike and that 717 Jobcentres had been
   unaffected.

--

   Those who have taken part in the action include:
     * Firefighters, who are on strike between 10:00 and 19:00 BST in a
       row over pensions and retirement age
     * The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) - which represents

   BBC political correspondent Norman Smith

   Strikes are meant to cause maximum pain for employers but in this case
   it doesn't look like this is happening.

   Why? Because far from causing the government much political grief,
   today's strikes by public sector workers are actually rather
   politically convenient.

--

   In particular, Prime Minister David Cameron is keen to include plans
   for a strike ballot threshold in his party's next manifesto.

   Today's strikes enable ministers to turn up the heat on Labour by
   pressing them to condemn the industrial action being carried out by
   their big union supporters.

   bullish stance.

   So, while in public ministers will appear angered by the strikes, in
   private they may be a good deal more relaxed.

Ballot turnouts

   The strikes went ahead despite the government arguing they are based on
   ballots conducted some years ago, with low turnout from union members.

--

   On Wednesday, Mr Cameron said the time had come for legislation setting
   a minimum turnout for a strike ballot, promising this in the next
   Conservative manifesto.

   Under the current law, a strike can take place if it is backed by a
   simple majority of those union members who vote - regardless of the
   level of turnout.

When are the train strikes and why are they taking place?

   1 June 2022
--

   Rail passengers are being warned of further disruption across Britain's
   railways, with strikes over Christmas and in early January.

   Industrial action is being taken in a dispute over pay, job security
   and working conditions.

   The RMT rail workers' union has announced strikes on:
     * Saturday 24 (from 18:00 GMT) until Tuesday 27 December (06:00 GMT)
     * Tuesday and Wednesday, 3-4 January
     * Friday and Saturday, 6-7 January

   Previous strikes by the RMT have had a major impact on services
   throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Passengers should check their
   train-operating company's website and only travel if absolutely

   says half of rail lines will be shut. Most of Scotland and Wales will
   have no trains running. Significant disruption is also likely on
   non-strike days.

   In addition, the train drivers' union, Aslef, has called a strike on 5
   January - between the RMT strikes.

   Its action will affect operations across 15 rail companies:
--
     * West Midlands Trains

   Unite the Union will also strike - affecting East Midlands Railway - on
   23 and 24 December.

   The TSSA union will strike - affecting Cross Country services - on 26
   and 27 December.

   It will also strike on 28 and 29 December, affecting GWR and West
   Midlands Railway.

When is the Eurostar strike?

   Security staff on the Eurostar train service were set to strike for
   four days in the run-up to Christmas.

   Strikes on 16 and 18 December were called off, while RMT members
   considered a pay offer.

   However, strikes on 22 and 23 December are still due to go ahead.

   The RMT said the strike would "severely affect" passengers. Eurostar
   said its services will not run to and from St Pancras in London on
   Boxing Day due to the UK high-speed line being closed because of strike
   action.

Strikes every day before Christmas - which sectors are affected and why

Workers from a host of industries have voted to strike, or are balloting to

while the cost of living soars across the UK.

   Wednesday 21 December 2022 14:19, UK

   the first time ever following the government failing to commit to
   formal pay negotiations after a five-day deadline ended in November.

   Thousands of NHS nurses went on strike on 15 and 20 December as they
   call for a rise of 5% above inflation - 19.2% - as they said they have
   had a real terms pay cut of 20% since 2010.

   The strikes resulted in thousands of cancelled NHS operations and

   including ambulance staff, midwives, physios, and hospital porters.

   Firefighters

   More than 33,000 firefighters and control room staff started voting on

   Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) are being asked if they want

General strike

   Article Talk

     * Edit

   A general strike refers to a strike action in which participants cease
   all economic activity, such as working, to strengthen the bargaining
   position of a trade union or achieve a common social or political goal.
--
   organizations and may also include rallies, marches, boycotts, civil
   disobedience, non-payment of taxes, and other forms of direct or
   indirect action. Additionally, general strikes might exclude care
   workers, such as teachers, doctors, and nurses.

   Historically, the term general strike has referred primarily to
   solidarity action, which is a multi-sector strike that is organised by
   trade unions who strike together in order to force pressure on
   employers to begin negotiations or offer more favourable terms to the
   strikers; though not all strikers may have a material interest in the
   negotiations, they all have a material interest in maintaining and
   strengthening the collective efficacy of strikes as a bargaining tool.

19th centuryEdit

   The general strike action only became a feature of the political
   landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first
   time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial
--

   The first theorist to formulate and popularise the idea of a general
   strike for the purpose of political reform was the radical pamphleteer
   William Benbow.^[1] Closely involved with planning the attempted
   Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817,^[2] he

   advocate direct and even violent action for political reform, in
   particular he advanced his idea for a "national holiday" and "national
   convention". By this he meant an extended period of general strike by
   the working classes, which would be a sacred or holy action (hence
   "holy-day"), during which time local committees would keep the peace
--
   In 1842 the demands for fairer wages and conditions across many
   different industries finally exploded into the first modern general
   strike (the 1842 general strike). After the second Chartist Petition
   was presented to Parliament in April 1842 and rejected, the strike
   began in the coal mines of Staffordshire, England, and soon spread
   through Britain affecting factories, mills in Lancashire and coal mines
   from Dundee to South Wales and Cornwall.^[6] Instead of being a
   spontaneous uprising of the mutinous masses, the strike was politically
   motivated and was driven by a hard-headed agenda to win concessions.
   Probably as much as half of the then industrial workforce were on
   strike at its peak—over 500,000 men. The local leadership marshaled a
   growing working-class tradition to politically organise their followers
   to mount an articulate challenge to the capitalist, political

   The mass abandonment of plantations by black slaves and poor whites
   during the American Civil War has, controversially, been considered a
   general strike. In his classic history Black Reconstruction in America,
   W. E. B. Du Bois describes this mass abandonment in precisely these
   terms:
--
     Transforming itself suddenly from a problem of abandoned plantations
     and slaves captured while being used by the [Southern] enemy for
     military purposes, the movement became a general strike against the
     slave system on the part of all who could find opportunity. The
     trickling streams of fugitives swelled to a flood. Once begun, the
     general strike of black and white went madly and relentlessly on
     like some great saga.^[7]

   The next large-scale general strike took place over half a century
   later in Belgium, in an effort to force the government to grant
   universal suffrage to the people.^[8] However, there were periodical
   strikes throughout the 19th century that could loosely be considered as
   'general strikes'. In the United States, the 1835 Philadelphia General
   Strike lasted for three weeks, after which the striking workers won
   their goal of a ten-hour workday and an increase in wages.^[9] Later
   general strikes include a one-week general strike of workers in the
   Central Pacific Railroad, a general strike that was not widely reported
   in the press or studied in literature because it was peaceful.,^[10]
   and the more violent and disruptive 1877 Saint Louis general strike,
   which grew out of the events of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877
   across the United States and the 1892 New Orleans general strike. The
   year of 1919 saw a cascade of general strikes around the world as a
   result of the political convulsions caused by the First World War—in
   Germany, Belfast, Seattle and Winnipeg.

   The 1905 general strike in Tampere, Grand Duchy of Finland

   The Russian Revolution of 1905 saw a massive wave of social unrest
   across the Russian Empire, characterised by large scale general strikes
   on the part of the industrial workers. The 1926 United Kingdom general
   strike started in the coal industry and rapidly escalated; the unions
   called out 1,750,000 workers, mainly in the transport and steel
   sectors, although the strike was successfully suppressed by the
   government.^[11]^[12]

20th centuryEdit

   A General Strike or Solidarity Strike was when various trade unions
   would go on strike sympathetically to help another trade union. General
   strikes were a sort of "nuclear option" for trade unions to all band
   together and go on a prolonged strike together.

   Ralph Chaplin, editor of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
   newspaper Solidarity and later of the Industrial Worker, identified
   four levels of general strike. rising from a community, to an industry,
   to a nationwide strike, and finally a revolutionary or class
   strike.^[13]

   In a 1905 pamphlet, published in Chicago, Stephen Naft acknowledged the
   same four levels of the general strike:

     [The name "General Strike"] is often used to designate the strike of
     all branches in one trade; for instance the general strike of the
     miners; when helpers and hoisting engineers, etc. are all out. Then
     it is used as: General Strike of a city, i.e., "General Strike in
     Florence", or a General Strike in a whole country or province, for
     the purpose of gaining political rights, i.e., the right to vote; as
     in Belgium, or Sweden.^[14] The profoundest conception of the
     General Strike, however, [is] the one pointing to a thorough change
     of the present system: a social revolution of the world; an entire
     new reorganisation; a demolition of the entire old system of all
     governments...^[14]

   — Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike

   Naft's 1905 pamphlet (translated from the German language) traced
   existing sentiment for this goal of the general strike to proletarians
   of Spain and Italy.^[15]

     The premise of The Social General Strike is that no matter how
     powerfully the working class organises itself, it still has no
     significant power over a congress, or the executive (which has
     military force at its beck and call). Therefore, a general strike
     called by an "energetic and enthusiastic" minority of workers, might
     be embraced by the mass of workers who remain unorganised. Thus it
--
     labour unions of all the means of production...^[16]

   The Social General Strike noted the complexity of modern industry,
   identifying the many stages in the manufacturing process and geographic
   dispersal of related manufacturing locations as weaknesses of the
   industrial process during any labour dispute.^[16] The pamphlet notes
   the problem of hunger during a general strike, and recommends where
   warehouses are available for the purpose, that proletarians,

--
   However, the pamphlet asserts that,

     The immense advantage of the general strike is that it begins
     entirely lawfully and without any danger for the workers, and for
     this reason thousands will take part...^[18]

   The year 1919 saw a number of general strikes throughout the United
   States and Canada, including two that were considered significant—the
   Seattle General Strike, and the Winnipeg General Strike. While the IWW
   participated in the Seattle General Strike, that action was called by
   the Seattle Central Labor Union, affiliated with the American
   Federation of Labor (AFL, predecessor of the AFL–CIO).^[19]
--
   In June 1919, the AFL national organisation, in session in Atlantic
   City, New Jersey, passed resolutions in opposition to the general
   strike. The official report of these proceedings described the
   convention as the "largest and in all probability the most important
   Convention ever held" by the organisation, in part for having
   engineered the "overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element"
   via crushing a "One Big Union proposition", and also for defeating a
   proposal for a nationwide general strike, both "by a vote of more than
   20 to 1."^[20] The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central
   labour union (i.e., regional labour councils) from "taking a strike
   vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union
   concerned".^[20] The change was intended to "check the spread of
   general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of what happened at
   Seattle and is now going on at Winnipeg."^[20] The penalty for any
   unauthorised strike vote was revocation of that body's charter.^[20]

   After the passage of the anti-union Taft–Hartley Act in 1947, the
   general strike changed from a tool of labor strike solidarity into a
   general form of social, political, and economic protest. Congress
   passed the law in the wake of the women-led 1946 Oakland General
   Strike. It outlawed actions taken by unionized workers in support of
   workers at other companies, effectively rendering both solidarity
   actions and the general strike itself illegal.^[21] Before 1947 and the
   passage of the Taft-Hartley Act the term general strike meant when
   various unions would officially go on strike in solidarity with other
   striking unions. The act made it illegal for one union to go on strike
   to support another. Hence, the definition and practice of a general
   strike changed in modern times to mean periodic days of mass action
   coordinated, often, by unions, but not an official or prolonged strike.

   Since then, in the US and Europe the general strike has become a tool
   of mass economic protest often in conjunction with other forms of
   electoral action and direct civil action.

   Debates on general strikesEdit

Socialists versus anarchistsEdit
--
   and early 20th century anarchists from socialists: electoral politics,
   which the socialists embraced, but anarchists generally opposed; and,
   the general strike as a mechanism to prevent war, which anarchists
   supported, but socialists refused to endorse.^[22]

   As a group, the socialists of the period repeatedly rejected the
   general strike as a tactic;^[23] however, a number of socialist leaders
   advocated its use for one reason or another.^[24] Socialist leaders who
   embraced the general strike tended to see it as an instrument for
   obtaining political concessions.^[23]

   Drachkovitch identified five types of general strikes:
     * the political mass strike, a general strike for political rights
       (such as the right to vote)
     * the general strike as a revolutionary act that would transform
       society
     * the general strike as a "revolutionary exercise" which would
       eventually lead to a transformation of society
     * a one-day demonstration general strike on May Day (International
       Workers' Day), aimed at identifying a "worldwide proletariat"
     * commencing in 1891, a theoretical mechanism by which to stop wars
--

   Drachkovitch perceived the first two concepts, the socialist-friendly
   general strike for political rights within the system, and the general
   strike as a revolutionary mechanism to overthrow the existing
   order—which he associated with a "rising anarcho-syndicalist
   movement"—as mutually exclusive.^[26] Drachkovitch believed that the
   difficulty arose from the fact that the general strike was "one
   instrument", but was frequently considered "without distinction of
   underlying motives."^[27]

   Milorad M. Drachkovitch also observed the variable success of the
   general strike in actual use:

     In Belgium a general strike movement, broken off in one instance
     without damage to the organizing forces, eventually led to universal
     suffrage; in Holland a general strike collapsed with disastrous
     consequences; in Sweden, a general strike was conducted and
     terminated with disciplined order but did not attain the desired
     results. In Italy, general strikes had been both socially effective
     and politically unproductive. On the other hand, the events of
     January 1905 in Russia once more seemed to underscore the
     suitability of the general strike as a decisively revolutionary
     action.^[27]

Syndicalism and general strikesEdit

   The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) began to fully embrace the
   general strike in 1910–1911.^[28] The ultimate goal of the general
   strike, according to Industrial Workers of the World theory, is to
   displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to
   workers.^[28]^[29] In a 1911 speech in New York City, IWW organiser
   Bill Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he
   believed a general strike was justified,

     The capitalists have wealth; they have money. They invest the money
--
     a mine, a railroad, a mill. They will keep that factory running just
     as long as there are profits coming in. When anything happens to
     disturb the profits, what do the capitalists do? They go on strike,
     don't they? They withdraw their finances from that particular mill.
     They close it down because there are no profits to be made there.
--

   Bill Haywood believed that industrial unionism made possible the
   general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial
   democracy.^[30] According to Wobbly theory, the conventional strike is
   an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and
   working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good
   training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle,
   and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for
   the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.^[31] During the final
   general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories,
   mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take
   them over.^[31] Prior to taking action to initiate industrial
--

   In 1927 the IWW called for a three-day nationwide walkout—in essence, a
   demonstration general strike—to protest the execution of anarchists
   Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.^[34] The most notable
   response to the call was in the Walsenburg coal district of Colorado,
   where 1,132 miners stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work,^[35] a
   participation rate which led directly to the Colorado coal strike of
   1927.

   On 18 March 2011, the Industrial Workers of the World supported an
   endorsement of a general strike as a follow-up to protests against
   Governor Scott Walker's proposed labour legislation in Wisconsin,
   following a motion passed by the South Central Federation of Labor
   (SCFL) of Wisconsin endorsing a statewide general strike as a response
   to those legislative proposals.^[36]^[37] The SCFL website states,

     At SCFL’s monthly meeting Monday, Feb. 21, delegates endorsed the
     following: "The SCFL endorses a general strike, possibly for the day
     Walker signs his 'budget repair bill.'" An ad hoc committee was
     formed to explore the details. SCFL did not CALL for a general
     strike because it does not have that authority.^[37]

       for higher wages and improved working conditions.^[43]
     * In February 1947, General Douglas MacArthur, as Supreme Commander
       of the Allied Powers in Japan, banned a planned general strike of
       2,400,000 government workers, stating that "so deadly a social
       weapon" as a general strike should not be used in the impoverished
       and emaciated condition of Japan so soon after World War II.
       Japan's labour leaders complied with his ban.^[44]

UCU Strikes

December 2022
--

   UCU, the University and College Union, have balloted and voted in
   favour of taking strike action over disputes over pay and working
   conditions, and pension cuts. Further information can be found on UCU's
   web pages about the strikes. Strike action will begin in November.

   The ballots were aggregated, which means that for the first time in
   these disputes, all universities in that ballot will be hit by strike
   action, rather than individual institutions. Over 70,000 university
   staff at 150 universities could now strike after University and College
   Union (UCU) members overwhelmingly voted 'yes' to strike action in two
   historic national ballots.

--

   We are already speaking to senior staff members at the University about
   the strikes and are committed to the actions set out in our active
   policy on this issue to mitigate the impact on the educational
   experience of taught students, as well as supporting our staff who are
--
   and we also respect the right of university staff to pursue industrial
   action. In particular, our members who are PGR students may be taking
   part in the strike, and we will support them for the benefit of their
   careers in academia.

   We plan to give regular updates on the strikes and have answered a
   range of questions below.  You can also see an overview of action which
   took place in 21-22.

   If you have concerns about how the strikes are affecting your
   education, you should contact your course rep who can bring this up at
   their Student-Staff Liaison Committee meetings, or with relevant staff
   members.

More info about the strikes

   What is the strike about?

   UCU members are currently involved in disputes over unsafe workloads,
   casualisation and equality failings, and USS pensions and pay. These
   issues are negotiated at a national level between representative bodies
   of Universities (e.g. UUK) and workers (e.g. UCU). Strikes are a
   legitimate tactic used by trade unions when they feel that the bodies
   they are negotiating with are not meeting their demands or making a
--
   at the beginning of their careers. UCU believes the cuts were not
   necessary and can now be revoked.
   When are the strike days?

   Strike action has been confirmed as taking place on the following days:
     * Thursday 24 November
     * Friday 25 November
     * Wednesday 30 November

   Staff will also begin industrial action short of strike action from
   Wednesday 23 November, which includes working to rule, refusing to make
   up work lost as a result of strike action and refusing to cover for
   absent colleagues.
   What is action short of a strike?

   Action short of a strike means that staff will not be doing any work
   beyond what is required to fulfil their contract; this includes not
   working extra hours, not covering for absent colleagues, not
   rescheduling lectures or classes cancelled due to strike action and not
   undertaking any voluntary activities.
   Will all staff be on strike?

   No, not all staff will be on strike. Some staff are members of other
   trade unions who have not secured a mandate to go on strike and so are
   not permitted to.  Lecturers do not have to notify the University
   before they go on strike so we cannot know exactly who will strike on
   any given day. In our experience, many lecturers will let you know if
   your teaching is going to be cancelled.
--
   On Thursday 24 November and Wednesday 30 November, it is planned that
   members of UNISON (usually professional services staff) will also be on
   strike, so there may be greater levels of disruption.
   What is a picket line?

   A picket line is a boundary established by staff on strike, especially
   at the entrance to the place of work, which striking staff ask others
   not to cross. It is likely that you will see picket lines outside some
   University buildings on strikes days, with staff holding placards,
   handing out campaign materials and talking to students and staff about
   their cause. In our experience they are peaceful and friendly
--

   If you are thinking about making a complaint, we would encourage you to
   wait to see how the University responds to the impact of the strike
   first. This is so you can explain why the arrangements that have been
   made have not mitigated the impact on your studies.

   A common way that you might be asked to show support to striking staff
   is to avoid “crossing picket lines” during the strike, e.g. by not
   attending teaching on strike days. The University advise that students
   who chose not to cross picket lines will need to take personal
   responsibility for the teaching and learning that they will be missing.
   We believe it is up to individual students to make up their minds about
   whether to cross picket lines, but will ensure that students are
   informed about this is as a way of supporting the strikes.

   Other ways that you can support striking staff are:

More info about how the strikes might affect students

   Will the strikes affect my lectures, seminars and tutorials?

   Only some lectures, seminars and tutorials will be cancelled due to
   strike action. Striking staff do not need to notify the University
   before they go on strike, so it is not possible to know in advance
   which teaching will be affected. In our experience, many striking staff
   will choose to let students know in advance if they are going to go on
   strike. We will be working with our network of course reps to look for
   ways that we can help disseminate any information about cancelled
   teaching to affected students.

   The university have taken a position that where lectures are cancelled
   due to the strike, lecture recordings will not be made available
   without permission of the lecturer. This supports the right of staff to
   take industrial action.

   The SU are working to mitigate the impact of the strikes
   on student’s educational experience. If you have concerns about how the
   strikes are affecting your education, please speak to your Course
   Representative.

--
   Picket lines are likely to be peaceful and friendly. We know that UCU
   members appreciate the show of solidarity from students who choose not
   to cross the picket lines, e.g. by not attending teaching on strike
   days. If you do not cross the picket line, the University expects you
   to take personal responsibility for missed teaching and learning.
--
   open and available?

   Some student services staff may be members of UCU and on strike, but
   the services will generally remain open. If individual appointments are
   cancelled, you will usually receive an email to let you know in
   advance.
   I am an international student - will the strikes affect my visa?

   Your visa should not be affected by strikes. If your lecturers are on
   strike, you will be given an authorised absence with a note to say that
   your absence is due to strikes. If your lecturers are not on strike,
   attendance monitoring will continue as normal. We have asked the
   University to ensure they provide specific information to international
   students about the strikes, but if you have any questions please
   contact Student Visa Services at the University.
   I am a PhD student - will the strikes affect my viva?

   If you have a viva that is scheduled for a strike day, the University
   should email you on an individual basis to let you know whether the
   viva will be taking place. You should assume that your viva will go
   ahead unless you hear otherwise.

   I feel that I have been unfairly disadvantaged by the strikes - what
   can I do about this?

   Bristol SU is working closely with University of Bristol staff to
   ensure that no student should be unfairly disadvantaged by the strike -
   for example, to make sure that students who have missed out on teaching
   can get changes or extensions to their assessments. If you feel that
   you have been unfairly impacted by the strikes, you can speak to one of
   our Academic Advice team who can advise you on how to tell the
   University about any extenuating circumstances, submit a complaint, or

   The University and College Union (UCU) balloted in October 2021 on
   taking strike action or ‘action short of a strike’ over disputes over
   pay and the USS pension scheme.

   The results of these ballots confirmed that University of Bristol
   academic staff and research postgraduates who teach, who are members of
   UCU, voted in favour of taking strike action in this academic year over
   pension disputes, and pay and conditions.

   Multiple periods of Industrial Action took place throughout the 2021-22
   academic year, including Action Short of a Strike.

   Your SU Officer team spoke to senior staff members at the University
   about the strikes and were committed to mitigating the impact on the
   educational experience of taught students, as well as supporting our
   staff who were striking.

   and management at Southern continue, we look at recent and historic

5. The Public Administration sector, Education sector and the Transport,
Storage, Information and Communication sector have seen the most working days
lost to strikes per 1,000 employees since 2006

   This is mainly because disputes in this group tend to be large.
   Education has also seen a large strike rate. This industry group has a

Industrial Strikes - Can You Claim Flight Compensation.

Get Started
--
   Flying Flying

   Airline strikes are, at best, inconvenient. At their worst, they could
   upend all your plans or cost you and your loved ones considerable
   amounts of money.

   If your flight is delayed or cancelled due to strikes, you may be
   eligible for compensation. This is thanks to EU Reg 261 and UK
   equivalent (Flight Compensation Regulation), which protects passengers
   whose flights are delayed or cancelled.

   In this guide, we’ll discuss the different kinds of strikes affecting
   flights, your rights as a passenger, and what to do if your plans
   change.

   In the event of strikes, under EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent you could

What are my rights if I’m affected by wildcat strikes?

   Wildcat strikes gained widespread media attention in 2016 after a
   multi-million-pound case was brought to the European Court of Justice.
   The case, Helga Krüsemann and Others v TUIfly GmbH, ruled that
   passengers could now claim for cancellations or delays for “wildcat”
   strikes.

   The term “wildcat strike” refers to a strike launched by airline staff
   at the last minute, as opposed to a strike that has been planned in
   advance.

--
Can you claim for a flight cancelled due to Air Traffic Control?

   The subject of Air Traffic Control strikes is a contentious one, with
   Air France strike compensation claims coming up time and again. In May
   2019 alone, there were 5,000 flights affected by strikes.

   Strictly speaking, Air Traffic Control should not ground flights for

What are my rights if there are airline crew strikes?

   According to the Civil Aviation Authority, you may be able to claim if
   airline employees call a strike.

   You will only be eligible for compensation if you meet the criteria of

   the EU or UK or arriving into the EU or UK on an EU or UK airline. With
   cancelled flights, you may only claim if you found out about the
   cancellation because of strikes less than two weeks before your flight.
   airport baggage truck airport baggage truck

What are my rights if baggage handlers or airport staff strike?

   Flight strike compensation claims are very much dependent on who calls
   the strike. When it comes to baggage handlers or airport staff, the law
   is not 100% clear and it’s likely that these claims would need to go to
   court for a judge to decide.

   The airline may argue that these strikes are ‘extraordinary’ and refuse
   to pay compensation as a result. This can make it difficult for
   passengers to claim any monetary compensation, which is one of the

What are my rights if my flights are delayed by strikes?

   Under EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent, you may be able to claim monetary

   You may also be able to claim if a strike has a knock-on effect on your
   flight. For example, if a strike happened the day before your flight
   and was lifted the day after, you could claim compensation for any
   resulting delays.

   Your airline must offer you a full refund if your flight is cancelled,

   Again, you will not be able to claim monetary compensation for

What should my airline do if a strike is imminent?

How to organise your own 'strike'

    1. Preparation
--
    7. Wrap up

   If you’re not near an organised strike, and there aren’t any young
   people interested in organising a strike in your area, that doesn’t
   mean you have to stay at home. Here are some tips on how to organise
   your own ‘strike'.

   30 Aug 2019
--
Preparation

   Get people to help you organise your strike. You’ll have an idea of
   which of your friends or group members are great people organisers and
   rabble raisers, or who is good on social media or good with a camera.
--
   responsibility for a certain area of work.

   Think about where you will hold your strike – ideally it will be
   somewhere accessible and recognisable where plenty of people can join,
   like outside your town hall, and will be scheduled to happen at the
   same time as the other strikes.

   You don’t need permission to organise a peaceful protest in a public
--

   You could also use our social media resources to let people know that
   there will be a strike in their local area. Create a Facebook event,
   invite your friends and share it with groups that you know might be
   interested.
--
Visualising

   Think about what you want your strike to look like and work with others
   to make sure it looks engaging and fun. You could use our resources to
   make your own placards and posters. You could even make one of our
--
       communications we make them invisible. Try to make sure that you
       remember this international aspect of climate justice in your
       strike prep and don’t just concentrate on the future effects of
       climate breakdown.

--

   You might be content to assemble and simply stand together for your
   strike, but you could also think about more interactive ways to keep
   people occupied.

   Here are some ideas of things you could do during your strike:
     * Give each person an A3 sheet of paper and a thick pen. Ask them to
       write on the paper why they are supporting the strike today. Take a
       photo of them holding their sign and share it on social media.
     * Got a big crowd? Why not lead them in some chants. You could use
--
     * Take a photo of your group together. If you haven’t made a banner
       you could write a message (like ‘Bridport supports the climate
       strikers’) on pieces of paper and hold them up together.

Have a conversation
--
   people about your next group meeting.

   You could also hand these out to any new people who join your strike
   but make sure you have a chat with them as well. It might be that they
   are a seasoned campaigner, deeply involved with other groups, or they
--
Share, Share, Share!

   Your strike won’t have shown solidarity with the youth strikers if they
   don’t know that it has happened – so you need to make sure that you can
   share the fruits of your labour on social media. Remember, if that

   You can read our guide on how to use social media if you'd like some
   tips. The hashtags we’ll be using for the strike are #ClimateStrike and

Public Sector Strikes

   Strikes are back in the news, with industrial action in the past week
   by oil refinery workers and school teachers. As a result, there is
   growing public concern at the cost of these strikes and the
   interruption to vital services.

   New TaxPayers’ Alliance research reveals that workers in the public
   sector go on strike far more than their private sector counterparts:
     * Over the last five years public sector workers have gone on strike
       for over 20 times as many days on average as workers in the private
       sector (see Table 2).
     * Over the last twelve months public sector workers have gone on
       strike for 895,000 working days, more than 100 times as many days
       on average as workers in the private sector (see Table 1).
     * This is despite public sector workers being paid more and being far
--
     “Public sector workers have learned from past cave-ins that this
     government is willing to compromise taxpayers’ interests in the face
     of strikes. They know that politicians are far too ready to spend
     our money to avoid political embarrassment. And with the public
     sector four times more unionised than the private, strikes have
     increased sharply, leaving ordinary taxpayers facing untold
     inconvenience and expense, as well as the prospect of even higher
     taxes to buy off the strikes.”

Support for striking workers declared by 600 Labour councillors

   More than 600 Labour councillors have declared their full backing for
   all rail, postal, dock and other workers on picket lines, as the party
   comes under continuing pressure over its stance on strikes.

   Amid a wave of strikes over pay and increasing talk of coordinated
   industrial action this autumn, the councillors signed an open letter

   The latest workers to go on strike are CWU postal workers who rejected

   are also 1,900 dockworker members of Unite at Felixstowe, the country’s
   biggest port, on an eight-day stoppage.

Employers’ guide: strikes and industrial action

     *
--
   Head of Employment

   Although strikes by employees are thankfully not a regular occurrence,
   statistics show an increase in strike action in the private
   sector relating to national and international issues, so it’s important
   to know what your rights are as an employer and what you can and can’t
   do if your staff decide to take industrial action. The right to strike
   in each country is impacted by regional and international law.

   Our expert employment law solicitors tell you what you need to know
   when employees are going on strike and if you can dismiss members of
   staff taking industrial action.

--
    1. What is industrial action?
    2. When is industrial action lawful?
    3. Haven’t the rules on strikes been tightened up?
    4. Can you dismiss employees for going on strike?
    5. Do you have to pay employees who are on strike?
    6. What can employers do to stop a strike?
    7. How can employers avoid industrial action?

What is industrial action?

   ‘Industrial action’ (going on strike) tends to occur when employees
   disagree with a business decision and want their employer to reverse
   it. For example, if you’re planning to reduce the number of working
   hours, your employees may go on strike to put pressure on you to change
   or alter these plans.

   Going on strike is the most common form of industrial action, but for
   the purposes of the law on industrial action, it includes ‘action short
   of a strike’ – overtime bans, call-out bans, work-to-rules, sit-ins and
   work-ins.

--
       ballot of union members. A majority of the members involved must
       support industrial action through the ballot. There have been some
       changes to the rules on this – see 'Haven’t the rules on strikes
       been tightened up recently?' below.
    3. Notification – as an employer, you need to be given:
--
    4. Not for a prohibited reason – industrial action can’t be taken for
       any of the following:
         1. Secondary action (supporting another strike
            which doesn’t involve that employee)
         2. Unlawful picketing
--
   If these conditions aren’t met, industrial action isn’t lawful and
   it won’t be automatically unfair to dismiss your employees for going on
   strike, even if the action is official. See 'Can you dismiss employees
   for going on strike?' below.

Haven’t the rules on strikes been tightened up?

   From March 2017, changes were made by the Trade Union Act 2016 to the
--
       there would have to be another ballot.
     * Ballot papers – they must set out the nature of the issues in
       dispute, the types of action ‘short of a strike’ (if that’s what’s
       proposed) and an ‘indication’ of time periods for action (but this
       doesn’t mean specific dates).
--
   Another significant change may be in the offing – the introduction of
   electronic voting. Trade unions had argued that one of the reasons
   for apparently low turnouts in strike ballots was the lack of e-voting
   and the Government has been considering the issue following the
   recommendations made in the independent review by Sir Ken Knight in
   2017.

Can you dismiss employees for going on strike?

   If employees go on strike, they’re breaching their employment contract.
   However, this doesn’t mean that you can dismiss them without the
   dismissal being classed as unfair. Your right to dismiss striking
--
   unfair dismissal, see our advice post What is a ‘fair’ dismissal?)

Do you have to pay employees who are on strike?

   When employees go on strike, you don’t need to pay them for the days
   they’re not at work. The question of how much to deduct can be
   surprisingly problematic. If the employees are paid hourly, it’s easy,
   but if they are salaried, pay normally accrues from day to day based on
   calendar (not working) days, unless you specify something else about
   strike pay in the employment contract.

   If the employees are acting ‘short of a strike’ (see 'What is
   industrial action?' above), then you can’t deduct pay. You will
   either have to pay the employees in full or demand that they comply
--
   agency staff you’re currently employing are unaffected).

What can employers do to stop a strike?

   As well as withholding pay, you can refuse to accept partial
--

   You will need to act quickly if you’re applying for an injunction – the
   union only needs to give you 14 days’ notice of a strike.

   If the strike has already gone ahead, you may be able to claim damages
   from the employees and union if it wasn’t lawful. Amounts are based on
   the union membership and subject to a statutory maximum (currently

 Junior doctor strikes in England had ‘significant impact’ on patient care

   by Kate Wighton
--
   20 February 2018

   The 2016 junior doctors strikes in England had a ‘significant’ impact
   on the provision of healthcare, with thousands of appointments
   cancelled.
--
   Health at Imperial, said: “Our research showed that the junior doctors’
   industrial action had a significant impact on care. As a result of the
   strike there were over 100,000 outpatient appointment cancellations and
   more than 25,000 fewer planned admissions than expected.”

   The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, showed there was no
   obvious change in the death rate during any of the strikes.

   In the first four months of 2016, junior doctors from all specialties
   across England went on strike in protest against contractual changes
   brought in by the government. Before these strikes there had been only
   one other strike in the previous 40 years, in 2012.

   Each of the four strikes lasted 24–48 hours: 12 January; 10 February;
   9-10 March; and 26-27 April. This last was the only strike that
   included withdrawal of emergency care.

--
   The researchers, who were funded by the National Institute for Health
   Research, therefore compared hospital activity the week of each of the
   strikes with that from the preceding and following weeks. They focused
   on numbers of admissions, outpatient appointments, and A&amp;E attendances.

--
   million outpatient appointments, and 3.4 million A&amp;E attendances.

   Compared with the weeks preceding and following the strikes, there were
   over 9% (31,651) fewer admissions, nearly 7% (23,895) fewer A&amp;E
   attendances, and 6% (173,462) fewer outpatient appointments than
   expected.

   April’s strike had the largest impact on services: there were over 15%
   (18,194) fewer admissions, including nearly 8% (3383) fewer emergency
   admissions, and almost 20% fewer planned admissions.

   Hospitals scheduled 11% (109,915) fewer outpatient appointments during
   this strike, while patients kept 134,711 (just over 17%) fewer of them.
   The number of outpatient appointments cancelled by hospitals also rose
   by almost 67% (43,823).

   During all four strikes, hospitals cancelled nearly 300,000 outpatient
   appointments – 52% higher than the volume expected for this period –
   possibly to protect more critical services, suggest the researchers.
--

   The number of recorded deaths didn’t change significantly during the
   strikes and wasn’t higher than expected, due to relatively small
   numbers. But hospital mortality is likely to be the least sensitive
   outcome for quality and safety concerns in this context, the

The 1972 Building Workers’ Strike

   The first national building workers strike was one of a large number of

   1972 saw the highest number of strike days in Britain since the General
   Strike in 1926. The Tory government called two States of Emergency. The
   first was in February 1972 during the miners’ strike. 15,000 trade
   unionists, including coal miners and local engineering workers closed
   the gates of Saltley coke depot in Birmingham. The second was in August

   It was different for the unions involved in the building dispute. Their
   national strike was unique because it was more difficult for building
   workers unions to organise workers in the industry. Building sites
   were, by their nature, temporary and geographically dispersed. They

   Some employers conceded the claim but the unions wanted to establish
   the principle that members throughout the country would be paid the
   same rate. An all-out strike was called in August and union members
   began to organise flying pickets to go to sites, usually in small towns
   and rural areas, which were still working. The flying picket proved to
   be a successful tactic. Instead of picketing sites where everyone had
   supported the strike and stopped working, union members decided to
   picket sites in smaller towns and other areas where support was not as
   strong. This proved to be very effective and the employers soon asked

   halt in work production leverages a demand to enforce workers’ rights.
   Despite this, the UK does not recognise the legal right to withdraw
   labour. Instead, the UK’s “right to strike” is said to depend on a
   complex statutory scheme[2].

   This article will analyse a variety of sources, “statutes such as
   TULRCA 1992, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law[3]”, to determine whether the UK’s “right to strike” “is a classic
   instance of a ‘legislated’ right[4]” or if it is merely a “slogan/legal
   metaphor[5]”.
--
   -

   ‘In truth, the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme. Even in jurisdictions where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document, such a
   complex right must be operationalised through labour statutes. It is a
   classic instance of a “legislated” right. Since the enactment of the
   Human Rights Act, and the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR, UK law
   may now be described as protecting a right to strike albeit one that is
   pieced together from a variety of sources: statutes such as TULRCA, the
   common law, Convention rights, and relevant case law.’[1]

   Does this statement accurately encapsulate the UK law on the ‘right to
   strike’? How do the different sources of law interact and what factors
   determine the correct balance to be reached between competing interests
   in regulating industrial action? Use case law, statute, legal

   affect innocent third parties (i.e. the general public).^[6] Therefore,
   in order to appease and ‘bring the labour under control’, the capital
   would ‘have to make concessions [i.e. comply with the strikers’ new
   terms], which provoke crises of profitability’.[7] However, the loss
   suffered by a business^[8] during and after industrial action is
   justified on two persuasive grounds. The first ground identified by
   Gwyneth Pitt is the human right aspect.^[9] To restrict the right to
   strike would be akin to the horrific period of slavery,^[10] where man
   had no power to withdraw his labour. This justification is recognising
   the inequalities in bargaining power between employer and
--
   of withdrawal of labour is the equilibrium argument. The power of the
   employer and their actions can only be matched and questioned by a
   ‘concerted stoppage of work’.^[14] Essentially, the right to strike is
   more than the withdrawal of labour: it is also the encompassing ‘right
   to free expression, association, assembly and power’.^[15] Yet there is
   ‘no positive legal right to strike in the UK’.^[16]

   Instead, ‘the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme’.^[17] In contrast to its neighbouring
   European countries’ (Spain and Italy) jurisdictions ‘where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document’, the UK law
   ‘protects a right to strike … from a variety of sources: statutes such
   as TULRCA, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law’.^[18] The accuracy of Bogg and Dukes’ encapsulation of the UK law
   on the ‘right to strike’ and how the different sources of law interact
   will be subsequently discussed.

--
   Judiciary

   While Spain^[19] and Italy^[20] protect the right to strike by
   suspending the contract of employment during industrial action, this
   contract is broken under English law.^[21] This is because the English
   common law does not confer a right to strike,^[22] hence ‘the rigour of
   the common law applies in the form of a breach of contract on part of
   the strikers and economic torts … [for] the organisers and their
   union’.^[23]

--
   its torts^[42] to protect ‘already powerful organisations’.^[43] Hence,
   from the perspective of trade unions and their members, the common
   law’s (inadequate) protection for the ‘right to strike’ has been,
   undeniably, very disappointing.

--
   Railway Co successfully sued the Amalgamated Society of Railway
   Servants union for £42,000.^[45] This sum is equivalent to
   £5,196,328.39 today. This verdict, in effect, eliminated ‘the strike as
   a weapon of organized labour’.[46] Naturally, workers turned to
   political parties for redress. The concern and advocacy for trade union
--
   economists, such as FA Hayek, viewed trade unions as an obstacle to
   economic growth.^[56] This perception was heightened by the Winter of
   Discontent (1978-79): a period characterised by widespread of strikes
   in response to the Labour government’s wage cap (to maintain falling
   inflation).^[57] Subsequently, Thatcher’s government further justified
--
   democracy, rights, and freedom of trade union members; ‘too often in
   recent years it has seemed that employees have been called out on
   strike by their unions without proper consultation and sometimes
   against their express wishes’.^[60] Accordingly, the Thatcher
   government introduced legislation that prior Conservative governments
--
   services’,^[66] 40% of all members entitled to vote must have voted in
   support of the industrial action. These stringent procedural
   requirements have to be strictly followed for a strike to be
   lawful.^[67] Oddly, there was no pressing need to introduce these
   restrictive measures.^[68] There were no significant problems in
   industrial relations at the time (ie, Winter of Discontent) nor any
   significant ‘pressure from business for further laws on strikes’,^[69]
   but the Conservative government justified these 2016 measures through
   the findings of Bruce Carr QC and Ed Holmes.^[70] The Government
--
   questioned the necessity of protecting industrial action by reflecting
   on the development of employment tribunals and discussing the economic
   consequences of strikes. The same ‘free-market economic theory’ that
   underpinned the MIR’s recommendations ‘drove’ the pragmatically
   restrictive and economically influenced 2016 statute developments.^[74]
--
   developed a three-part test to examine the legality of industrial
   action. This test encapsulates the substantive and procedural
   requirements for a lawful strike whilst observing the intertwined and
   ‘uneasy’ relationship between the common law and statute.^[82] If the
   industrial action is unlawful at common law, the judiciary asks whether
--
   the statutory rules’^[86]; there is a series of High Court instances of
   injunctions being granted to ‘ever more powerful and well-resourced
   employers’^[87] owing to invalid strike ballots.^[88] The readily
   available labour injunctions continued to be the “key piece^[89]” of
   suppressing collective action until the minor development in 2011.
--
   indicated a change in emphasis rather than substance’^[96] (since
   unions are still burdened with the challenges of exercising a ‘lawful’
   strike),^[97] this judgment enhanced union’s ability to resist
   injunction applications (as observed by Balfour Beatty Engineering
   Services Limited v Unite the Union).^[98] The unbiased interpretation
--
   The ECtHR confirmed, in Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey,^[100] that
   Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights included
   protection of the right to strike. This Article, and Article 6 of the
   European Social Charter^[101] bestow the right to strike for their
   member states members and due to the UK Human Rights Act 1998, ‘British
   workers are understood to enjoy a right to strike’.^[102] This, unlike
   the mere domestic statutory immunities, is the only instance of a
   ‘legislated’ right to strike in the UK.^[103]

   Under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, ‘statutory provisions
--
   be the leading precedent on the UK’s provisions of Article 11,^[107]
   despite the RMT and ASLEF judgment. In RMT and ASLEF, the UK courts
   acknowledged the ‘clearly protected’^[108] right to strike under ECHR
   Article 11. However, the court emphasised the importance of a ‘fair
   balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual
--
   ECtHR (and Human Rights Act 1998) in ‘controversial’ matters such as
   industrial action. This review has the powerful ability to eliminate
   the only instance of a legislated right to strike in the UK.^[125]


--
   ‘The notion of lawful industrial action is restrictive’, the procedural
   requirements are ‘onerous’ and the consequences of unions liability for
   unlawful strikes are ‘serious’.^[126] Nearly two decades after the
   European Social Charter’s review,^[127] the UK still does not guarantee
   the right to strike. The precedent in Metrobus still stands. There
   continues to be a ‘poorly reasoned and barely consistent’ series of
   judgments ‘by what looks like a weak, timid’^[128] and politically
   influenced^[129] judiciary. The enactment of the ‘Human Rights Act and
   the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR’^[130] will not prescribe a
   right to strike in the UK until the Supreme Court or ECtHR rule UK’s
   current provisions as incompatible with Article 11.

   In truth, ‘the right to strike [in the UK] has never been much more
   than a slogan or a legal metaphor’.^[131] This ‘slogan’ is a regime of
   immunities that are purposely designed upon an overly complex and
--
   injunctions, and unfair dismissals.^[134] This system was successfully
   underlined with the political agenda of deterring trade disputes; the
   UK’s worker strike total has fallen to its ‘lowest level since
   1893’.^[135]  The ‘unanimous and hostile’^[136] approach of the
   legislature and the judiciary towards industrial action exhibits the

Private sector strike days hits highest level in over twenty years – 346,000 in
                                   last year

--
   4 years ago

     * Recent high profile strikes by workers at McDonald’s and TGI
       Friday’s

   The number of working days lost to strike action in the private sector
   has hit a twenty year high of 346,000 in the last year, says EMW, the
   commercial law firm.

   The number of private sector days lost to strikes more than doubled
   (140%) in the past year, up from 144,000 from 2016-17. The 346,000 days
   lost is the highest number of days lost in a single year since 1996-97.

   EMW adds that there have been a number of high-profile strikes in the
   private sector, in particular in the retail and leisure sectors,
   including:
--
       2018 over the restaurant group’s changes in policy over the sharing
       of tips
     * McDonald’s workers at branches across the UK went on strike over
       demands for a minimum £10-an-hour living wage in May 2018

   Strikes in the public transport sector also helped increase the number
   of days lost to strikes, with workers on South Western Railway and
   Northern Rail taking industrial action.

   The record high number of days lost to strikes in the private sector
   comes as the number of days lost in the public sector hits a record low
   10,000 in the same year. This is down by over 90% from 136,000 the

   EMW explains that the Trade Union Act, which came into force in March
   2017, has toughened the requirements that unions needed to meet for
   strikes in the public sector. Amongst other measures it introduced
   requirements for strikes to proceed of:
     * At least 50% minimum turnout

   Jon Taylor, Principal at EMW, comments:

     “A twenty year high for days lost to strikes will concern many
     businesses.”

     “There could be even more days lost to strikes with employees
     frequently using social media platforms, such as WhatsApp, to
     organise unofficial strike action through sick leave – as has been
     reportedly the case with one major dispute in the railways sector.

     “In addition to newer, tougher legislation, contrasting levels of

   EMW adds that the latest strike figures suggest that organised strikes

New styles of strikes and protest are emerging in the UK

   This article by Emma Sara Hughes, PhD Candidate in Employment
--
   published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

   The image of strikers picketing outside factory gates is usually seen
   as something from the archives. Official statistics show an almost
   perennial decline in formal strikes. In the month of January 2018 there
   were 9,000 recorded working days lost due to strikes – a tiny fraction
   of the 3m recorded in January 1979.

   Yet there has been a noticeable increase in private sector working days
   lost from strike action. In January 2018, the figure stood at 231,000
   working days lost. That is 146,000 more days than in January 2017 and
   166,000 more than than January 2016.

   Another reason may be because real wages have plummeted, while

The 1972 Building Workers’ Strike

   The first national building workers strike was one of a large number of
   industrial disputes in 1972. They included miners, steelworkers, car
   workers and dockers. These disputes had been successful for the unions
--
   action by trade union members.

   1972 saw the highest number of strike days in Britain since the General
   Strike in 1926. The Tory government called two States of Emergency. The
   first was in February 1972 during the miners’ strike. 15,000 trade
   unionists, including coal miners and local engineering workers closed
   the gates of Saltley coke depot in Birmingham. The second was in August
   1972, during the dockers dispute. The Conservative Government tried to
   use the Industrial Relations Act 1971 to emasculate the unions’ ability
--

   It was different for the unions involved in the building dispute. Their
   national strike was unique because it was more difficult for building

   Some employers conceded the claim but the unions wanted to establish
   the principle that members throughout the country would be paid the

   began to organise flying pickets to go to sites, usually in small towns
   and rural areas, which were still working. The flying picket proved to
   be a successful tactic. Instead of picketing sites where everyone had
   supported the strike and stopped working, union members decided to
   picket sites in smaller towns and other areas where support was not as
   strong. This proved to be very effective and the employers soon asked
   for further talks with the unions.

RIGHT TO STRIKE

Abstract

   Striking, overtime bans and refusing to carry out certain tasks[1] are
   collective forms of actions that can arise from workplace disputes.
   These industrial actions are of fundamental importance: the temporary
   halt in work production leverages a demand to enforce workers’ rights.
   Despite this, the UK does not recognise the legal right to withdraw
   labour. Instead, the UK’s “right to strike” is said to depend on a
   complex statutory scheme[2].

   This article will analyse a variety of sources, “statutes such as
   TULRCA 1992, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law[3]”, to determine whether the UK’s “right to strike” “is a classic
   instance of a ‘legislated’ right[4]” or if it is merely a “slogan/legal
   metaphor[5]”.

   ‘In truth, the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme. Even in jurisdictions where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document, such a
   complex right must be operationalised through labour statutes. It is a
   classic instance of a “legislated” right. Since the enactment of the
   Human Rights Act, and the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR, UK law
   may now be described as protecting a right to strike albeit one that is
   pieced together from a variety of sources: statutes such as TULRCA, the
   common law, Convention rights, and relevant case law.’[1]

   Does this statement accurately encapsulate the UK law on the ‘right to
   strike’? How do the different sources of law interact and what factors
   determine the correct balance to be reached between competing interests
   in regulating industrial action? Use case law, statute, legal
--
   illustrations to support your analysis.

   In line with socialism and Professor Beverly Silver’s assertions,
   capitalism is established upon ‘two contradictory tendencies’: ‘crises
   of profitability and crises of social legitimacy’.^[2] This ‘inherent
--
   welfare.^[4]

   Striking, overtime bans, and refusing to carry out certain tasks are
   collective forms of actions that can arise from workplace disputes.^[5]
   These disputes typically occur because employers are unwilling to
--
   affect innocent third parties (i.e. the general public).^[6] Therefore,
   in order to appease and ‘bring the labour under control’, the capital
   would ‘have to make concessions [i.e. comply with the strikers’ new
   terms], which provoke crises of profitability’.[7] However, the loss
   suffered by a business^[8] during and after industrial action is
   justified on two persuasive grounds. The first ground identified by
   Gwyneth Pitt is the human right aspect.^[9] To restrict the right to
   strike would be akin to the horrific period of slavery,^[10] where man
   had no power to withdraw his labour. This justification is recognising
   the inequalities in bargaining power between employer and
--
   of withdrawal of labour is the equilibrium argument. The power of the
   employer and their actions can only be matched and questioned by a
   ‘concerted stoppage of work’.^[14] Essentially, the right to strike is
   more than the withdrawal of labour: it is also the encompassing ‘right
   to free expression, association, assembly and power’.^[15] Yet there is
   ‘no positive legal right to strike in the UK’.^[16]

   Instead, ‘the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme’.^[17] In contrast to its neighbouring
   European countries’ (Spain and Italy) jurisdictions ‘where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document’, the UK law
   ‘protects a right to strike … from a variety of sources: statutes such
   as TULRCA, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law’.^[18] The accuracy of Bogg and Dukes’ encapsulation of the UK law
   on the ‘right to strike’ and how the different sources of law interact
   will be subsequently discussed.

--
   Judiciary

   While Spain^[19] and Italy^[20] protect the right to strike by
   suspending the contract of employment during industrial action, this
   contract is broken under English law.^[21] This is because the English
   common law does not confer a right to strike,^[22] hence ‘the rigour of
   the common law applies in the form of a breach of contract on part of
   the strikers and economic torts … [for] the organisers and their
   union’.^[23]

--
   its torts^[42] to protect ‘already powerful organisations’.^[43] Hence,
   from the perspective of trade unions and their members, the common
   law’s (inadequate) protection for the ‘right to strike’ has been,
   undeniably, very disappointing.


    1. Statutes

   Legislature
--
   One of the major problems facing trade unions was the ‘exposure of
   their funds to legal action by employers’^[44]; in 1901, Taff Vale
   Railway Co successfully sued the Amalgamated Society of Railway
   Servants union for £42,000.^[45] This sum is equivalent to
   £5,196,328.39 today. This verdict, in effect, eliminated ‘the strike as
   a weapon of organized labour’.[46] Naturally, workers turned to
   political parties for redress. The concern and advocacy for trade union
--
   economists, such as FA Hayek, viewed trade unions as an obstacle to
   economic growth.^[56] This perception was heightened by the Winter of
   Discontent (1978-79): a period characterised by widespread of strikes
   in response to the Labour government’s wage cap (to maintain falling
   inflation).^[57] Subsequently, Thatcher’s government further justified
   the re-introduction of liability for trade unions upon the succeeding
   Green Papers: the 1981 Trade Union Immunities^[58] and the 1989 Trade
--
   democracy, rights, and freedom of trade union members; ‘too often in
   recent years it has seemed that employees have been called out on
   strike by their unions without proper consultation and sometimes
   against their express wishes’.^[60] Accordingly, the Thatcher
   government introduced legislation that prior Conservative governments
--
   limiting its previously protected scope and purposes.

   Subsequently, the process of placing further controls on trade unions
   continued into the 21^st century.^[63] The 2015 Conservative government
   introduced the ‘draconian’^[64] Trade Union Act 2016 (TUA) – the most
--
   services’,^[66] 40% of all members entitled to vote must have voted in
   support of the industrial action. These stringent procedural
   requirements have to be strictly followed for a strike to be
   lawful.^[67] Oddly, there was no pressing need to introduce these
   restrictive measures.^[68] There were no significant problems in
   industrial relations at the time (ie, Winter of Discontent) nor any
   significant ‘pressure from business for further laws on strikes’,^[69]
   but the Conservative government justified these 2016 measures through
   the findings of Bruce Carr QC and Ed Holmes.^[70] The Government
--
   questioned the necessity of protecting industrial action by reflecting
   on the development of employment tribunals and discussing the economic
   consequences of strikes. The same ‘free-market economic theory’ that
   underpinned the MIR’s recommendations ‘drove’ the pragmatically
   restrictive and economically influenced 2016 statute developments.^[74]
--
   The substance of today’s statute in protecting trade unions ‘is far
   removed and much weaker than the position established in 1906’.^[75]
   Since the Henry Campbell-Bannerman leadership, trade union membership
   has declined by more than half due to the ‘three successive
   Conservative governments [who] have enacted labour legislation opposed
--
   justify interpreting the statute provisions ‘strictly against the trade
   union’, the court’s overall response to industrial action ‘has been
   more mixed’.^[80] The court in Merkur Island Shipping v Laughton^[81]
   developed a three-part test to examine the legality of industrial
   action. This test encapsulates the substantive and procedural
   requirements for a lawful strike whilst observing the intertwined and
   ‘uneasy’ relationship between the common law and statute.^[82] If the
   industrial action is unlawful at common law, the judiciary asks whether
--
   the statutory rules’^[86]; there is a series of High Court instances of
   injunctions being granted to ‘ever more powerful and well-resourced
   employers’^[87] owing to invalid strike ballots.^[88] The readily
   available labour injunctions continued to be the “key piece^[89]” of
   suppressing collective action until the minor development in 2011.

   In RMT v Serco Ltd; ASLEF v London and Birmingham Railway Limited (RMT
   and ASLEF),^[90] the Court of Appeal approved and applied Millett LJ’s
   1996 observation in London Underground Limited v National Union of
   Railwaymen, Maritime and Transport Staff:^[91] ‘the democratic
   requirement of a secret ballot is not to make life more difficult for
   trade unions … but for the protection of the Union’s own members’.^[92]
   Owing to this proposed democratic aim, the court in RMT and ASLEF
   confirmed it was ‘to interpret the statutory provisions somewhat less
   stringently’.^[93] This interpretation is a stark contrast to Maurice
--
   power to mitigate unions disproportionate vulnerability against
   injunctions, damages, and unfair dismissals by encouraging and
   favouring social legitimacy. Although, the RMT and ASLEF court ‘only
   indicated a change in emphasis rather than substance’^[96] (since
   unions are still burdened with the challenges of exercising a ‘lawful’
   strike),^[97] this judgment enhanced union’s ability to resist
   injunction applications (as observed by Balfour Beatty Engineering
   Services Limited v Unite the Union).^[98] The unbiased interpretation
   encouraged in RMT and ASLEF continues to be the leading approach to
   interpreting domestic statutes regarding industrial action.

--
   Admittedly, the scope of Maurice Kay LJ’s strict interpretation was
   narrowly limited by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).^[99]
   The ECtHR confirmed, in Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey,^[100] that
   Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights included
   protection of the right to strike. This Article, and Article 6 of the
   European Social Charter^[101] bestow the right to strike for their
   member states members and due to the UK Human Rights Act 1998, ‘British
   workers are understood to enjoy a right to strike’.^[102] This, unlike
   the mere domestic statutory immunities, is the only instance of a
   ‘legislated’ right to strike in the UK.^[103]

   Under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, ‘statutory provisions
--
   interpretation of UK statutory provisions. This judgment continues to
   be the leading precedent on the UK’s provisions of Article 11,^[107]
   despite the RMT and ASLEF judgment. In RMT and ASLEF, the UK courts
   acknowledged the ‘clearly protected’^[108] right to strike under ECHR
   Article 11. However, the court emphasised the importance of a ‘fair
   balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual
--
   secondary action owing to its ‘potential to … cause broad disruption
   within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the
   public’.^[110] Subsequently, the court confirmed that this ban aligns
   with Article 11(2) ‘on the basis of a wide margin of appreciation
   accorded to the State’.^[111]  While the court is correct to recognise
   their bestowed margin of appreciation, the court rationalised the
   granting of the injunction, ‘which itself cost the union a substantial
--
   Legislature

   The RMT and ASLEF court’s ‘blessing of a wide margin of appreciation’
   in the ‘encompassment’ of Article 11 offered a ‘green light for further
   restrictive legislation on industrial action’ by the ‘only too happy
--
   domestic courts and the ECtHR works effectively and if there is room
   for improvement’.^[122] It is worth highlighting that this
   ‘independent’ review will be led by former Court of Appeal Judge, Sir
   Peter Gross – the same judge who remarked that ‘the more that
   controversial areas are “outsourced” … the greater the challenge for …
--
   ECtHR (and Human Rights Act 1998) in ‘controversial’ matters such as
   industrial action. This review has the powerful ability to eliminate
   the only instance of a legislated right to strike in the UK.^[125]


--
   ‘The notion of lawful industrial action is restrictive’, the procedural
   requirements are ‘onerous’ and the consequences of unions liability for
   unlawful strikes are ‘serious’.^[126] Nearly two decades after the
   European Social Charter’s review,^[127] the UK still does not guarantee
   the right to strike. The precedent in Metrobus still stands. There
   continues to be a ‘poorly reasoned and barely consistent’ series of
   judgments ‘by what looks like a weak, timid’^[128] and politically
   influenced^[129] judiciary. The enactment of the ‘Human Rights Act and
   the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR’^[130] will not prescribe a
   right to strike in the UK until the Supreme Court or ECtHR rule UK’s
   current provisions as incompatible with Article 11.

   In truth, ‘the right to strike [in the UK] has never been much more
   than a slogan or a legal metaphor’.^[131] This ‘slogan’ is a regime of
   immunities that are purposely designed upon an overly complex and
--
   injunctions, and unfair dismissals.^[134] This system was successfully
   underlined with the political agenda of deterring trade disputes; the
   UK’s worker strike total has fallen to its ‘lowest level since
   1893’.^[135]  The ‘unanimous and hostile’^[136] approach of the
   legislature and the judiciary towards industrial action exhibits the

   climate strike 2019

Global Climate Strikes 14 February 2020

   On 14 February 2020, schools may be empty but the streets will be full.
   Young people are calling on everyone to join the climate strikes across

Private sector strike days hits highest level in over twenty years – 346,000 in
                                   last year

     * Recent high profile strikes by workers at McDonald’s and TGI
       Friday’s

   The number of working days lost to strike action in the private sector
   has hit a twenty year high of 346,000 in the last year, says EMW, the
   commercial law firm.

   The number of private sector days lost to strikes more than doubled
   (140%) in the past year, up from 144,000 from 2016-17. The 346,000 days
   lost is the highest number of days lost in a single year since 1996-97.

   EMW adds that there have been a number of high-profile strikes in the
   private sector, in particular in the retail and leisure sectors,
   including:
--
       2018 over the restaurant group’s changes in policy over the sharing
       of tips
     * McDonald’s workers at branches across the UK went on strike over
       demands for a minimum £10-an-hour living wage in May 2018

   Strikes in the public transport sector also helped increase the number
   of days lost to strikes, with workers on South Western Railway and
   Northern Rail taking industrial action.

   The record high number of days lost to strikes in the private sector
   comes as the number of days lost in the public sector hits a record low
   10,000 in the same year. This is down by over 90% from 136,000 the
--
   EMW explains that the Trade Union Act, which came into force in March
   2017, has toughened the requirements that unions needed to meet for
   strikes in the public sector. Amongst other measures it introduced
   requirements for strikes to proceed of:
     * At least 50% minimum turnout
     * In ‘important public services’, such as health and education, a

   Jon Taylor, Principal at EMW, comments:

     “A twenty year high for days lost to strikes will concern many
     businesses.”

     “There could be even more days lost to strikes with employees
     frequently using social media platforms, such as WhatsApp, to
     organise unofficial strike action through sick leave – as has been
     reportedly the case with one major dispute in the railways sector.
     Staff do not necessarily need a union to lead action and can
     organise coordinated absences independently.”

     “In addition to newer, tougher legislation, contrasting levels of
     strikes in the private and public sector reflect overall changing
     work practices. Over the long-term, there has been a continued shift
     of individuals working in the private sector, along with a fall in

   EMW adds that the latest strike figures suggest that organised strikes
   in the private sector are now going on for much longer. There were 144
   stoppages in the last year, compared with 101 in the previous year. As

   to 3,089 to 1,425.

   Number of working days lost in the private sector to strikes hits 20

New styles of strikes and protest are emerging in the UK

   This article by Emma Sara Hughes, PhD Candidate in Employment
   Relations, at Bangor Business School and Tony Dundon, Professor of HRM
   &amp; Employment Relations, University of Manchester was originally
   published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

   The image of strikers picketing outside factory gates is usually seen
   as something from the archives. Official statistics show an almost
   perennial decline in formal strikes. In the month of January 2018 there
   were 9,000 recorded working days lost due to strikes – a tiny fraction
   of the 3m recorded in January 1979.

   Yet there has been a noticeable increase in private sector working days
   lost from strike action. In January 2018, the figure stood at 231,000
   working days lost. That is 146,000 more days than in January 2017 and
   166,000 more than than January 2016.

   absenteeism, minor acts of defiance, mischief or sabotage. The Centre
   of Economic and Business consultancy reports year-on-year increases in
   absenteeism since 2011. Short disputes and other types of protest are
   excluded from official strike statistics – hence, many go unnoticed.

   Newer patterns of resistance include social media campaigns over

   Another reason may be because real wages have plummeted, while
   unemployment is at its lowest since the peak of strike activity in the
   mid-1970s (now 4.3%), thereby giving workers a greater degree of
   confidence in pressing their demands.
--
   Another possible explanation is that people now expect more and want
   immediate change. This is exemplified in shock votes for Donald Trump
   in the US, Brexit or even Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity.

   A new moral consciousness may even have replaced a former industrial

   People are not satisfied with this status quo and are calling for
   change. So, as well as the more traditional style of organised action,
   some workers are expressing this new potential moral consciousness with
   subtle active protest such as the lunchtime protests, worker sit-ins

Legal challenge against ‘strike-breaking’ law

   Eleven trade unions, coordinated by the TUC have begun legal
   proceedings to protect the right to strike. The unions – ASLEF, BFAWU,
   FDA, GMB, NEU, NUJ, POA, PCS, RMT, Unite and Usdaw – have taken the
   case against the government’s new regulations which allow agency
   workers to fill in for striking workers and break strikes. TUC
   affiliated unions UNISON and NASUWT are also launching separate
   individual legal cases against the government’s agency worker
   regulations. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The right to
   strike is a fundamental British liberty. But the government is
   attacking it in broad daylight.” She added: “Ministers failed to
   consult with unions, as the law requires. And restricting the freedom
   to strike is a breach of international law. That’s why unions are
   coming together to challenge this change in the courts.” The TUC has
   also made a complaint to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

   HGV drivers and shunters at Mullers’ Stonehouse factory in
   Gloucestershire are taking further strike action over imposed rota
   changes they say are detrimental to their quality of life. The change
   to a five days on, two days off rota system contravenes an agreement
   with Unite signed by the company earlier this year. Nearly 70 staff,
   responsible for delivering milk and other dairy products to M&amp;S and
   Waitrose nationwide, had already taken nine days of strike action since
   25 August. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Muller’s knows

   wrong that strikes are preventing hard-working people and families up
   and down the country from getting to work, doctors' appointments and
   school," a government source said.

What is happening to the right to strike?


   We've heard a lot about strikes in the media this year, as the
   government passed their Trade Union Act in May. And much of the
   coverage has portrayed ordinary working people with genuine grievances
--
   businesses to their knees.

   The truth is less dramatic. People only ever go on strike as an
   absolute last resort. Strikes happen where workers feel strongly that
   they are still being unfairly treated and not listened to – strongly
   enough to go without pay while on strike, and put themselves through
   what is often a stressful experience.

   Under UK employment law, workers have the right not to be dismissed or
   suffer detriment for going on strike, providing some pretty stringent
   conditions are met. Nevertheless, the government wrote its assault on
   strikes into law with the Trade Union Act, which puts even tighter
   limits on what now constitutes legitimate industrial action and, in the
   words of TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady, “attacks the right to
   strike – a fundamental British liberty. It poses a serious threat to
   good industrial relations and is completely unnecessary.”

   It hasn't yet been implemented, but the Act's provisions will include
   minimum turnouts for strike votes (hard to reach as unions are also
   banned from using online or workplace voting systems), tighter time
   limits on mandates for strikes, restrictions on
   picketing and bureacratic changes which will give employers chances to
   use the courts to stop strikes. Workers will still technically have
   a right to strike, but the Act makes the right much harder to access.

The real story of industrial action today

   Just how unnecessary this new Act is is borne out by the latest stats
   on strike action:
     * Less than 3 in 100,000 working days were lost to strike action in
       2015
     * 81,000 people went on strike last year – the lowest number since
       records began
     * Only 106 strikes took place in 2015 – that’s twenty times fewer
       than in 1975!
     * Strikes are very rare and seldom last longer than three days

   Trade unions were joined by Liberty, Amnesty International, the
--
   piece of legislation.

   Attacks on the basic right to strike are attacks on the ability of
   ordinary workers to successfully negotiate fair pay, conditions and
   practices. Like Deliveroo’s couriers and workers at this London cinema.

   LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer goods group Unilever Plc/NV has agreed on
   Friday to talks with British trade union leaders to try and resolve a
   dispute over pensions which led to a series of strikes at its UK plants
   over the last two months.

   British workers walked out on strike after Unilever moved to axe its
   final salary pension scheme, a move that will hit pensions for 5,000 of
   the group’s 7,000 UK employees. The strike action is the first in
   Britain in the group’s 82-year history.

   Around a third of Unilever’s British workforce are union members and
   were involved in a one-day strike in December, and then in 11 days of
   rolling strikes across the group’s 12 UK plants and offices during
   January.
