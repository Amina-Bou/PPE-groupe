Submitting a complaint in relation to the UCU strike action

Which procedure should I use?

   Please consider whether your concern should be raised as an appeal or a
   complaint.

     Possible reasons for submitting an appeal on the basis of the strike
     impact:
     * I answered questions for which I did not receive teaching
     * I was incorrectly or inadequately advised about changes made to
       assessment(s) and this led to disadvantage
     * I have specific needs which mean the strike response impacted me
       differently to others in my cohort
     * The response to the strike breached the University's own procedures
     * My cohort has a specific set of circumstances, and the response to
       the strike did not take account of these.

     There may be other circumstances which merit investigation under the
     academic appeals process, but these would have to be along similar
     lines to the listed circumstances.

     YUSU (for undergraduates) and the GSA (for postgraduates) both offer
     specialist advice free of charge to help you with the complaints and
     appeals processes. For further information see:
     * The YUSU Academic Issues page  or email asc@yusu.org. (for
       undergraduates)
     * The GSA Academic Advice page or email advice@yorkgsa.org (for
       postgraduates)

     Possible reasons for submitting a complaint on the basis of the
     strike impact:
     * The University has not delivered on its contractual obligations to
       me
     * The response to the strike led to a significant lowering of
       teaching quality which had a material impact on me
     * One or more of the University’s services were negatively affected
       by the strike

     If you wish to make a complaint, please complete the form.

     To help us address your complaint as quickly as possible:
     * Please ensure you use the correct procedure; If you are not sure if
       it is a complaint or an appeal please contact complaints@york.ac.uk
       for advice
     * Be specific about why you consider the University has not fulfilled
       its obligations as a result of the strike and how you have been
       affected personally;
     * Please explain why you feel that the mitigating actions taken by
       the University have not been adequate;
     * Indicate what steps you took to minimise your losses (for example,
       did you take advantage of office hours or attempt to contact module
       leaders on non-strike days)
     * Please provide all relevant evidence to support your complaint -
       the Complaints team will not gather this for you.
     * The complaints procedure cannot result in changes to your marks or
       degree outcome.
