Five Reasons Workers Strike

   Cargill workers at the High River plant, have issued a strike notice to
   the company through their union.

   Workers may hit the picket line first week of December if negotiations
   fail.

   Cargill workers pay their union dues and in return their union
   represents them in bargaining negotiations. Their bargaining demands
   are around:
     * Increased wages for all including full retroactive pay
     * Increased signing bonus
     * Fair ways to monitor line speeds
     * Limitations on benefit costs and co-pays
     * Increased benefit coverage
     * Health and safety improvements
     * Sick leave
     * Improvements to shift scheduling

   Why Strike?
    1. The ability to strike is a fundamental part of the right organize
       and collectively bargain recognized in Canada. On June 14, 2017,
       Canada ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining
       Convention, 1949 (No. 98).
    2.  It is legal. The Supreme Court of Canada recognizes the
       constitutional right to strike for Canadian workers in a 2015
       decision. The right to strike is constitutionally protected under
       the freedom of association in section 2(d) of the Canadian Charter
       of Rights and Freedoms.
    3. Negotiation and compromise are at the core of employment
       relationships. Workers want it because they want to avoid being at
       the complete mercy of employers. One of their objectives is to
       change the balance of power between workers and employer.
    4.  Most strikes are about pay and better working conditions. Without
       the threat of strike action, corporations will be able to make
       bigger profits, while working conditions will get worse.
    5. Strike is part of their bargaining tool. Striking is sometimes
       their last legal option.
