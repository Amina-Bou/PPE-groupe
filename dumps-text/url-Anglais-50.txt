New styles of strikes and protest are emerging in the UK

   This article by Emma Sara Hughes, PhD Candidate in Employment
   Relations, at Bangor Business School and Tony Dundon, Professor of HRM
   & Employment Relations, University of Manchester was originally
   published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

   The image of strikers picketing outside factory gates is usually seen
   as something from the archives. Official statistics show an almost
   perennial decline in formal strikes. In the month of January 2018 there
   were 9,000 recorded working days lost due to strikes – a tiny fraction
   of the 3m recorded in January 1979.

   Yet there has been a noticeable increase in private sector working days
   lost from strike action. In January 2018, the figure stood at 231,000
   working days lost. That is 146,000 more days than in January 2017 and
   166,000 more than than January 2016.

   And it’s not just those on the left who are striking. Workers are also
   agitated in modern and union-free enterprises. For example, Ryanair was
   forced to bargain with trade unions after pilots across Europe
   threatened industrial action, despite its flamboyant CEO, Michael
   O’Leary, once proclaiming that “hell would freeze over” before his
   company recognised a union. McDonald’s workers in Cambridge and London
   also went on strike over pay and zero-hours contracts late last year,
   with talk of more action to come.

   adjusted). : Labour Disputes Inquiry, Office for National Statistics
   Working days lost in the UK (cumulative 12-month totals, not seasonally
   adjusted). : Labour Disputes Inquiry, Office for National StatisticsThe
   beginning of 2018 witnessed some high profile strikes in key sectors:
   at a number of railways over safety; at water company United Utilities
   over pay and working conditions; at IT giant Fujitsu over job losses;
   and thousands of lecturers across more than 60 universities have been
   striking over pensions.
   What’s all the fuss about?

   People are worried about their pay, working conditions, future earnings
   and security at a time when the world of work is changing.

   University lecturers are angered not only at the reduced pension deal
   being offered by their employers’ group, Universities UK. Views are
   mixed but many are also aggrieved at their own union, the University
   and College Union, for recommending an offer that some local activists
   and members view as falling short on their demands.

   Evidently conflict has not been eradicated from modern workplaces.
   Employees in multiple sectors also protest in other ways such as
   absenteeism, minor acts of defiance, mischief or sabotage. The Centre
   of Economic and Business consultancy reports year-on-year increases in
   absenteeism since 2011. Short disputes and other types of protest are
   excluded from official strike statistics – hence, many go unnoticed.

   Newer patterns of resistance include social media campaigns over
   precarious zero-hour contracts, “lunchtime protests” such as those at
   HM Revenue & Customs and Bentley cars, government lobbying by workers
   at engineering firm GKN over a takeover, or worker sit-ins as staged by
   hundreds of Hinckley Point power station workers over pay. Meanwhile
   students have occupied university premises in solidarity with striking
   lecturers.

The shadow of Brexit

   Predicting cause and effect for social phenomena is difficult. Protests
   are often attributed to employment and economic cycles, combined with
   changing social values of younger people.

   The emergent wave of dissent may indicate we are approaching what some
   economists call a long-wave “Kondratieff cycle” – named after the
   Russian economist Nikolai Kondratieff. Here economic cycles can stretch
   over longer periods – say ten, 20 or 40 years.

   If the mid-1990s was an “upswing”, slumping with the 2008 financial
   crisis, growing dissent may signal another long-wave turning point,
   fuelled by fears of the UK’s fragile future. For instance, in July 2017
   the UK’s fiscal watchdog warned that Britain’s public finances were
   worse than on the eve of the financial crash. Coupled with the
   Conservatives losing their majority in government, it may be that the
   real effect of Brexit is only now materialising and compounding the ill
   effects of austerity.

   Another reason may be because real wages have plummeted, while
   unemployment is at its lowest since the peak of strike activity in the
   mid-1970s (now 4.3%), thereby giving workers a greater degree of
   confidence in pressing their demands.

Changing social values

   Another possible explanation is that people now expect more and want
   immediate change. This is exemplified in shock votes for Donald Trump
   in the US, Brexit or even Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity.

   A new moral consciousness may even have replaced a former industrial
   working-class ideology. Younger and female labour market participation
   rates have burgeoned but so too has the gender pay gap and inequality.
   Multiculturalism, social inclusion, global employment issues are all
   catalysts for pioneering human rights values for businesses.

   People are not satisfied with this status quo and are calling for
   change. So, as well as the more traditional style of organised action,
   some workers are expressing this new potential moral consciousness with
   subtle active protest such as the lunchtime protests, worker sit-ins
   and social media campaigns.

   Analysis also points to “conflict benefits”: for example striking
   lecturers report lower stress levels, renewed energy and an enjoyment
   of the solidarity that comes from protest. Research also shows that
   conflict can support creativity and open disagreement can incite
   productive outcomes.

   Whether we are entering a Kondratieff upswing or witnessing a new
   active moral consciousness is unclear. Nevertheless, it may be that
   protest can produce positive outcomes not only for workers, but also
   help companies to better engage with their workforce.
