General strike

   Article Talk

   A general strike refers to a strike action in which participants cease
   all economic activity, such as working, to strengthen the bargaining
   position of a trade union or achieve a common social or political goal.
   They are organised by large coalitions of political, social, and labour
   organizations and may also include rallies, marches, boycotts, civil
   disobedience, non-payment of taxes, and other forms of direct or
   indirect action. Additionally, general strikes might exclude care
   workers, such as teachers, doctors, and nurses.

   Historically, the term general strike has referred primarily to
   solidarity action, which is a multi-sector strike that is organised by
   trade unions who strike together in order to force pressure on
   employers to begin negotiations or offer more favourable terms to the
   strikers; though not all strikers may have a material interest in the
   negotiations, they all have a material interest in maintaining and
   strengthening the collective efficacy of strikes as a bargaining tool.

   HistoryEdit

19th centuryEdit

   The general strike action only became a feature of the political
   landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first
   time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial
   working class; they lived in cities and exchanged their labour for
   payment. By the 1830s, when the Chartist movement was at its peak, a
   true and widespread 'workers' consciousness' was beginning to awaken in
   England.

   William Benbow pictured in Punch in 1848

   The first theorist to formulate and popularise the idea of a general
   strike for the purpose of political reform was the radical pamphleteer
   William Benbow.^[1] Closely involved with planning the attempted
   Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817,^[2] he
   became an associate of William Cobbett and passed his time "agitating
   the labouring classes at their trades meetings and club-houses."^[2]

   On 28 January 1832 Benbow published a pamphlet entitled Grand National
   Holiday and Congress of the Productive Classes.^[3] Benbow began to
   advocate direct and even violent action for political reform, in
   particular he advanced his idea for a "national holiday" and "national
   convention". By this he meant an extended period of general strike by
   the working classes, which would be a sacred or holy action (hence
   "holy-day"), during which time local committees would keep the peace
   and elect delegates to a national convention or congress, which would
   agree the future direction of the nation. The striking workers were to
   support themselves with savings and confiscated parish funds, and by
   demanding contributions from rich people.^[4]

   Benbow's idea of a Grand National Holiday was adopted by the Chartist
   Congress of 1839, Benbow having spent time in Manchester during 1838-9
   promoting the cause and his pamphlet.^[5]

   In 1842 the demands for fairer wages and conditions across many
   different industries finally exploded into the first modern general
   strike (the 1842 general strike). After the second Chartist Petition
   was presented to Parliament in April 1842 and rejected, the strike
   began in the coal mines of Staffordshire, England, and soon spread
   through Britain affecting factories, mills in Lancashire and coal mines
   from Dundee to South Wales and Cornwall.^[6] Instead of being a
   spontaneous uprising of the mutinous masses, the strike was politically
   motivated and was driven by a hard-headed agenda to win concessions.
   Probably as much as half of the then industrial workforce were on
   strike at its peak—over 500,000 men. The local leadership marshaled a
   growing working-class tradition to politically organise their followers
   to mount an articulate challenge to the capitalist, political
   establishment.

   The mass abandonment of plantations by black slaves and poor whites
   during the American Civil War has, controversially, been considered a
   general strike. In his classic history Black Reconstruction in America,
   W. E. B. Du Bois describes this mass abandonment in precisely these
   terms:

     Transforming itself suddenly from a problem of abandoned plantations
     and slaves captured while being used by the [Southern] enemy for
     military purposes, the movement became a general strike against the
     slave system on the part of all who could find opportunity. The
     trickling streams of fugitives swelled to a flood. Once begun, the
     general strike of black and white went madly and relentlessly on
     like some great saga.^[7]

   The next large-scale general strike took place over half a century
   later in Belgium, in an effort to force the government to grant
   universal suffrage to the people.^[8] However, there were periodical
   strikes throughout the 19th century that could loosely be considered as
   'general strikes'. In the United States, the 1835 Philadelphia General
   Strike lasted for three weeks, after which the striking workers won
   their goal of a ten-hour workday and an increase in wages.^[9] Later
   general strikes include a one-week general strike of workers in the
   Central Pacific Railroad, a general strike that was not widely reported
   in the press or studied in literature because it was peaceful.,^[10]
   and the more violent and disruptive 1877 Saint Louis general strike,
   which grew out of the events of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877
   across the United States and the 1892 New Orleans general strike. The
   year of 1919 saw a cascade of general strikes around the world as a
   result of the political convulsions caused by the First World War—in
   Germany, Belfast, Seattle and Winnipeg.

   The 1905 general strike in Tampere, Grand Duchy of Finland

   The Russian Revolution of 1905 saw a massive wave of social unrest
   across the Russian Empire, characterised by large scale general strikes
   on the part of the industrial workers. The 1926 United Kingdom general
   strike started in the coal industry and rapidly escalated; the unions
   called out 1,750,000 workers, mainly in the transport and steel
   sectors, although the strike was successfully suppressed by the
   government.^[11]^[12]

20th centuryEdit

   A General Strike or Solidarity Strike was when various trade unions
   would go on strike sympathetically to help another trade union. General
   strikes were a sort of "nuclear option" for trade unions to all band
   together and go on a prolonged strike together.

   Ralph Chaplin, editor of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
   newspaper Solidarity and later of the Industrial Worker, identified
   four levels of general strike. rising from a community, to an industry,
   to a nationwide strike, and finally a revolutionary or class
   strike.^[13]

   In a 1905 pamphlet, published in Chicago, Stephen Naft acknowledged the
   same four levels of the general strike:

     [The name "General Strike"] is often used to designate the strike of
     all branches in one trade; for instance the general strike of the
     miners; when helpers and hoisting engineers, etc. are all out. Then
     it is used as: General Strike of a city, i.e., "General Strike in
     Florence", or a General Strike in a whole country or province, for
     the purpose of gaining political rights, i.e., the right to vote; as
     in Belgium, or Sweden.^[14] The profoundest conception of the
     General Strike, however, [is] the one pointing to a thorough change
     of the present system: a social revolution of the world; an entire
     new reorganisation; a demolition of the entire old system of all
     governments...^[14]

   — Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike

   Naft's 1905 pamphlet (translated from the German language) traced
   existing sentiment for this goal of the general strike to proletarians
   of Spain and Italy.^[15]

     The premise of The Social General Strike is that no matter how
     powerfully the working class organises itself, it still has no
     significant power over a congress, or the executive (which has
     military force at its beck and call). Therefore, a general strike
     called by an "energetic and enthusiastic" minority of workers, might
     be embraced by the mass of workers who remain unorganised. Thus it
     may be possible, ...to completely interrupt production in the whole
     country, and stop communication and consumption for the ruling
     classes, and that for a time long enough to totally disorganise the
     capitalistic society; so that after the complete annihilation of the
     old system, the working people can take possession through its
     labour unions of all the means of production...^[16]

   The Social General Strike noted the complexity of modern industry,
   identifying the many stages in the manufacturing process and geographic
   dispersal of related manufacturing locations as weaknesses of the
   industrial process during any labour dispute.^[16] The pamphlet notes
   the problem of hunger during a general strike, and recommends where
   warehouses are available for the purpose, that proletarians,

     ...do the same thing as the ruling classes have done uninterruptedly
     for thousands of years: that is, "consume without producing." This
     deportment of the ruling classes the working class calls
     exploitation, and if the proletarians do it, the possessing classes
     call it plundering—and socialism calls it expropriation.^[17]

   However, the pamphlet asserts that,

     The immense advantage of the general strike is that it begins
     entirely lawfully and without any danger for the workers, and for
     this reason thousands will take part...^[18]

   The year 1919 saw a number of general strikes throughout the United
   States and Canada, including two that were considered significant—the
   Seattle General Strike, and the Winnipeg General Strike. While the IWW
   participated in the Seattle General Strike, that action was called by
   the Seattle Central Labor Union, affiliated with the American
   Federation of Labor (AFL, predecessor of the AFL–CIO).^[19]

   In June 1919, the AFL national organisation, in session in Atlantic
   City, New Jersey, passed resolutions in opposition to the general
   strike. The official report of these proceedings described the
   convention as the "largest and in all probability the most important
   Convention ever held" by the organisation, in part for having
   engineered the "overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element"
   via crushing a "One Big Union proposition", and also for defeating a
   proposal for a nationwide general strike, both "by a vote of more than
   20 to 1."^[20] The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central
   labour union (i.e., regional labour councils) from "taking a strike
   vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union
   concerned".^[20] The change was intended to "check the spread of
   general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of what happened at
   Seattle and is now going on at Winnipeg."^[20] The penalty for any
   unauthorised strike vote was revocation of that body's charter.^[20]

   In the fight in the Indian Independence Movement lead by Mahatma Gandhi
   Gandhi promoted the use of what is called Hartal, a mass protest and a
   form of civil disobedience that often involved a total shutdown of
   workplaces, offices, shops, and courts of law.

LegalityEdit

   After the passage of the anti-union Taft–Hartley Act in 1947, the
   general strike changed from a tool of labor strike solidarity into a
   general form of social, political, and economic protest. Congress
   passed the law in the wake of the women-led 1946 Oakland General
   Strike. It outlawed actions taken by unionized workers in support of
   workers at other companies, effectively rendering both solidarity
   actions and the general strike itself illegal.^[21] Before 1947 and the
   passage of the Taft-Hartley Act the term general strike meant when
   various unions would officially go on strike in solidarity with other
   striking unions. The act made it illegal for one union to go on strike
   to support another. Hence, the definition and practice of a general
   strike changed in modern times to mean periodic days of mass action
   coordinated, often, by unions, but not an official or prolonged strike.

   Since then, in the US and Europe the general strike has become a tool
   of mass economic protest often in conjunction with other forms of
   electoral action and direct civil action.

   Debates on general strikesEdit

Socialists versus anarchistsEdit

   In 1966, in a study of revolutionary socialism, Milorad M. Drachkovitch
   of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace (a conservative
   think tank), noted two tactical options which divided late 19th century
   and early 20th century anarchists from socialists: electoral politics,
   which the socialists embraced, but anarchists generally opposed; and,
   the general strike as a mechanism to prevent war, which anarchists
   supported, but socialists refused to endorse.^[22]

   As a group, the socialists of the period repeatedly rejected the
   general strike as a tactic;^[23] however, a number of socialist leaders
   advocated its use for one reason or another.^[24] Socialist leaders who
   embraced the general strike tended to see it as an instrument for
   obtaining political concessions.^[23]

   Drachkovitch identified five types of general strikes:
     * the political mass strike, a general strike for political rights
       (such as the right to vote)
     * the general strike as a revolutionary act that would transform
       society
     * the general strike as a "revolutionary exercise" which would
       eventually lead to a transformation of society
     * a one-day demonstration general strike on May Day (International
       Workers' Day), aimed at identifying a "worldwide proletariat"
     * commencing in 1891, a theoretical mechanism by which to stop wars
       between nation states^[25]

   Drachkovitch perceived the first two concepts, the socialist-friendly
   general strike for political rights within the system, and the general
   strike as a revolutionary mechanism to overthrow the existing
   order—which he associated with a "rising anarcho-syndicalist
   movement"—as mutually exclusive.^[26] Drachkovitch believed that the
   difficulty arose from the fact that the general strike was "one
   instrument", but was frequently considered "without distinction of
   underlying motives."^[27]

   Milorad M. Drachkovitch also observed the variable success of the
   general strike in actual use:

     In Belgium a general strike movement, broken off in one instance
     without damage to the organizing forces, eventually led to universal
     suffrage; in Holland a general strike collapsed with disastrous
     consequences; in Sweden, a general strike was conducted and
     terminated with disciplined order but did not attain the desired
     results. In Italy, general strikes had been both socially effective
     and politically unproductive. On the other hand, the events of
     January 1905 in Russia once more seemed to underscore the
     suitability of the general strike as a decisively revolutionary
     action.^[27]

Syndicalism and general strikesEdit

   The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) began to fully embrace the
   general strike in 1910–1911.^[28] The ultimate goal of the general
   strike, according to Industrial Workers of the World theory, is to
   displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to
   workers.^[28]^[29] In a 1911 speech in New York City, IWW organiser
   Bill Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he
   believed a general strike was justified,

     The capitalists have wealth; they have money. They invest the money
     in machinery, in the resources of the earth. They operate a factory,
     a mine, a railroad, a mill. They will keep that factory running just
     as long as there are profits coming in. When anything happens to
     disturb the profits, what do the capitalists do? They go on strike,
     don't they? They withdraw their finances from that particular mill.
     They close it down because there are no profits to be made there.
     They don't care what becomes of the working class. But the working
     class, on the other hand, has always been taught to take care of the
     capitalist's interest in the property.^[30]

   Bill Haywood believed that industrial unionism made possible the
   general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial
   democracy.^[30] According to Wobbly theory, the conventional strike is
   an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and
   working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good
   training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle,
   and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for
   the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.^[31] During the final
   general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories,
   mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take
   them over.^[31] Prior to taking action to initiate industrial
   democracy, workers would need to educate themselves with technical and
   managerial knowledge in order to operate industry.^[31]

   According to labor historian Philip S. Foner, the Wobbly conception of
   industrial democracy is intentionally not presented in detail by IWW
   theorists; in that sense, the details are left to the "future
   development of society".^[32] However, certain concepts are implicit.
   Industrial democracy will be "a new society [built] within the shell of
   the old."^[33] Members of the industrial union educate themselves to
   operate industry according to democratic principles, and without the
   current hierarchical ownership/management structure. Issues such as
   production and distribution would be managed by the workers
   themselves.^[33]

   In 1927 the IWW called for a three-day nationwide walkout—in essence, a
   demonstration general strike—to protest the execution of anarchists
   Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.^[34] The most notable
   response to the call was in the Walsenburg coal district of Colorado,
   where 1,132 miners stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work,^[35] a
   participation rate which led directly to the Colorado coal strike of
   1927.

   On 18 March 2011, the Industrial Workers of the World supported an
   endorsement of a general strike as a follow-up to protests against
   Governor Scott Walker's proposed labour legislation in Wisconsin,
   following a motion passed by the South Central Federation of Labor
   (SCFL) of Wisconsin endorsing a statewide general strike as a response
   to those legislative proposals.^[36]^[37] The SCFL website states,

     At SCFL’s monthly meeting Monday, Feb. 21, delegates endorsed the
     following: "The SCFL endorses a general strike, possibly for the day
     Walker signs his 'budget repair bill.'" An ad hoc committee was
     formed to explore the details. SCFL did not CALL for a general
     strike because it does not have that authority.^[37]

   On 26 November 2020, a nationwide general strike of 250 million people,
   as per trade unions claim, took place in support of Indian farmers'
   protests.^[38]

   The largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced
   industrial country—and the first general wildcat strike in history—was
   May 1968 in France.^[39] The prolonged strike involved eleven million
   workers for two weeks in a row,^[39] and its impact was such that it
   almost caused the collapse of the de Gaulle government. Other notable
   general strikes include:

     * In Portugal, a general strike was called in 2011 by the federation
       of public labour unions to avert austerity measures.^[40]

       farmers and other organisations demanding better education, an
       increase in the minimum wage and against fuel price hikes.^[41]
     * In Yemen, thousands of people took the streets in a general strike
       in 2011 to protest President Ali Abdullah Saleh.^[42]
     * In Algeria, public sector workers in 2011 mounted a general strike
       for higher wages and improved working conditions.^[43]
     * In February 1947, General Douglas MacArthur, as Supreme Commander
       of the Allied Powers in Japan, banned a planned general strike of
       2,400,000 government workers, stating that "so deadly a social
       weapon" as a general strike should not be used in the impoverished
       and emaciated condition of Japan so soon after World War II.
       Japan's labour leaders complied with his ban.^[44]

    1. ^ ^a ^b ^c "plebeian secession" was a tactic used by the Roman
       plebs of vacating a city entirely and leaving its ruling elite to
       fend for itself, thus an even more radical action than a "general
       strike", yet unlike the latter term, it does not pertain to
       withholding labour within a wage-system. General strikes in the
       current sense of the term only begin to take place in a context
       where in which labour is treated as a commodity, and wage workers
       collectively organise to halt production.
