RIGHT TO STRIKE

Abstract

   Striking, overtime bans and refusing to carry out certain tasks[1] are
   collective forms of actions that can arise from workplace disputes.
   These industrial actions are of fundamental importance: the temporary
   halt in work production leverages a demand to enforce workers’ rights.
   Despite this, the UK does not recognise the legal right to withdraw
   labour. Instead, the UK’s “right to strike” is said to depend on a
   complex statutory scheme[2].

   This article will analyse a variety of sources, “statutes such as
   TULRCA 1992, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law[3]”, to determine whether the UK’s “right to strike” “is a classic
   instance of a ‘legislated’ right[4]” or if it is merely a “slogan/legal
   metaphor[5]”.

   -

   ‘In truth, the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme. Even in jurisdictions where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document, such a
   complex right must be operationalised through labour statutes. It is a
   classic instance of a “legislated” right. Since the enactment of the
   Human Rights Act, and the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR, UK law
   may now be described as protecting a right to strike albeit one that is
   pieced together from a variety of sources: statutes such as TULRCA, the
   common law, Convention rights, and relevant case law.’[1]

   Does this statement accurately encapsulate the UK law on the ‘right to
   strike’? How do the different sources of law interact and what factors
   determine the correct balance to be reached between competing interests
   in regulating industrial action? Use case law, statute, legal
   commentary and social science material in your answer and provide
   illustrations to support your analysis.

   In line with socialism and Professor Beverly Silver’s assertions,
   capitalism is established upon ‘two contradictory tendencies’: ‘crises
   of profitability and crises of social legitimacy’.^[2] This ‘inherent
   labour-capital’^[3] struggle is reflected within the UK’s hostile
   regulation of industrial action. The courts’ and legislature’s
   ideological approaches towards the collective right to withdraw labour
   unanimously and substantially favours economic growth above social
   welfare.^[4]

   Striking, overtime bans, and refusing to carry out certain tasks are
   collective forms of actions that can arise from workplace disputes.^[5]
   These disputes typically occur because employers are unwilling to
   negotiate with employees and workers about their working terms or
   conditions. Undeniably, the duration – and the aftermath – of the
   collective action results in financial losses to the business and
   affect innocent third parties (i.e. the general public).^[6] Therefore,
   in order to appease and ‘bring the labour under control’, the capital
   would ‘have to make concessions [i.e. comply with the strikers’ new
   terms], which provoke crises of profitability’.[7] However, the loss
   suffered by a business^[8] during and after industrial action is
   justified on two persuasive grounds. The first ground identified by
   Gwyneth Pitt is the human right aspect.^[9] To restrict the right to
   strike would be akin to the horrific period of slavery,^[10] where man
   had no power to withdraw his labour. This justification is recognising
   the inequalities in bargaining power between employer and
   employee.^[11] This inequality has been further escalated by the growth
   of the modern-day unstable gig economy; one in nine UK workers are in
   precarious work.^[12] This form of work has limited protection and much
   lower salaries.^[13] Hence, a subsequent ground for the justification
   of withdrawal of labour is the equilibrium argument. The power of the
   employer and their actions can only be matched and questioned by a
   ‘concerted stoppage of work’.^[14] Essentially, the right to strike is
   more than the withdrawal of labour: it is also the encompassing ‘right
   to free expression, association, assembly and power’.^[15] Yet there is
   ‘no positive legal right to strike in the UK’.^[16]

   Instead, ‘the “right to strike” in the UK depends for its realisation
   on a complex statutory scheme’.^[17] In contrast to its neighbouring
   European countries’ (Spain and Italy) jurisdictions ‘where the right to
   strike is specified textually in a constitutional document’, the UK law
   ‘protects a right to strike … from a variety of sources: statutes such
   as TULRCA, the common law, Convention rights, and relevant case
   law’.^[18] The accuracy of Bogg and Dukes’ encapsulation of the UK law
   on the ‘right to strike’ and how the different sources of law interact
   will be subsequently discussed.


    1. Common Law

   Judiciary

   While Spain^[19] and Italy^[20] protect the right to strike by
   suspending the contract of employment during industrial action, this
   contract is broken under English law.^[21] This is because the English
   common law does not confer a right to strike,^[22] hence ‘the rigour of
   the common law applies in the form of a breach of contract on part of
   the strikers and economic torts … [for] the organisers and their
   union’.^[23]

   It is tortious and indefensible^[24] to induce an individual to breach
   their contract of employment.^[25] This principle was established in
   Lumley v Gye,^[26] and this liability extends to trade unions in the
   context of industrial action.^[27] Additionally, there are two further
   economic torts trade unions can be held liable for: liability for
   conspiracy to injure (Quinn v Leathem)^[28] and causing loss by
   unlawful means. Until OBG Ltd v Allan, Douglas, and others v Hello!
   Ltd,^[29] the ‘tort of procuring a breach of contract had been
   [“blurred”^[30] and] extended [to be a wider] tort of unlawful
   interference with contractual relations’.^[31] These torts were later
   distinguished and separated in the House of Lord’s (HoL) judgment of
   OBG v Allan.

   While it is not often, the courts are encouraged to distinguish and
   introduce new torts. The HoL in OBG v Allan subsequently outlined the
   distinguishing elements between unlawful means and the tort of
   procuring a breach of contract. The tort of procuring a breach of
   contract is an accessory liability. Whilst the tort of unlawful means
   is a ‘primary liability that is not dependent on the third party having
   committed a wrong against the claimant’.^[32] Yet, despite the tort
   differences, the HoL confirmed that the same act could give rise to
   liability under both unlawful interference and procuring a breach of
   contract.^[33] This clarification and the development of unlawful
   interferences as a separate liability has notably accommodated
   employers in holding trade unions liable for more than one tort.

   The OBG v Allan judgment is significant for discussing industrial
   action for two notable reasons. The first is that it confirms the
   judiciary’s ‘uncontrolled power’[34] in developing and ‘defining torts
   boundaries on a case-to-case basis.[35] This power is ‘ensur[ing] that
   trade unions cannot provide a lawful excuse or justification for their
   actions’^[36]; trade unions are ultimately ‘stood naked and unprotected
   at the altar of the common law’.^[37] The insufficiency of protection
   for trade unions under the common law exhibits the judiciary’s biased
   and hostile ideology towards industrial action.^[38] This subsequently
   aligns with the following observation: the courts favour economic
   profits. This is discerned by the extent to which the contemporary
   judiciary extends protection for commercial bodies.^[39] The primary
   function of English tort law was to protect physical integrity and
   property rights; tort law was never concerned with the protection of
   economic interests.^[40] Nor had the common law ever been historically
   exercised to ‘legitimately control aspects of the economy’^[41] and yet
   OBG v Allan demonstrates the extent to which this has now changed. The
   judiciary has extensively and needlessly stretched the common law and
   its torts^[42] to protect ‘already powerful organisations’.^[43] Hence,
   from the perspective of trade unions and their members, the common
   law’s (inadequate) protection for the ‘right to strike’ has been,
   undeniably, very disappointing.


    1. Statutes

   Legislature

   One of the major problems facing trade unions was the ‘exposure of
   their funds to legal action by employers’^[44]; in 1901, Taff Vale
   Railway Co successfully sued the Amalgamated Society of Railway
   Servants union for £42,000.^[45] This sum is equivalent to
   £5,196,328.39 today. This verdict, in effect, eliminated ‘the strike as
   a weapon of organized labour’.[46] Naturally, workers turned to
   political parties for redress. The concern and advocacy for trade union
   reform accounted for 59% of the winning Liberal party’s election
   manifesto.^[47] The Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Henry
   Campbell-Bannerman, provided unions with wide immunity against any
   tortious liability arising from trade disputes under The Trade Disputes
   Act (TDA) 1906. Although this Act did not introduce a ‘legislated
   right’ for industrial action,^[48] this statute effectively recognised
   the vulnerability of unions under the common law by ‘secur[ing] a
   [statutory] freedom’ instead.^ [49] The TDA is one of the
   ‘most important pieces of labour legislation ever passed by a British
   Parliament’^[50]; it effectively ‘kept the courts at a minimum’^[51]
   and neutralised the most obvious adverse effects of the Taff Vale
   judgment. The ‘sympathetic politicians’ were ‘periodically
   reconstructing’ the role of the ‘class-conscious’, profit-favouring
   judiciary.^[52] The outcome of the 1906 general election ‘served the
   unions’ interests well’^[53] and it continued to for 65 years.

   The ‘long enjoyed’^[54] immunity of trade unions for liability in tort
   was reduced to partial immunity under the Thatcher government
   (1979-90). There is a ‘scale of government ideology’ which ranges from
   ‘fully participative’ to ‘fully authoritative’,^[55] and the Thatcher
   government was the undoubtable latter. The Conservative ideology and
   economists, such as FA Hayek, viewed trade unions as an obstacle to
   economic growth.^[56] This perception was heightened by the Winter of
   Discontent (1978-79): a period characterised by widespread of strikes
   in response to the Labour government’s wage cap (to maintain falling
   inflation).^[57] Subsequently, Thatcher’s government further justified
   the re-introduction of liability for trade unions upon the succeeding
   Green Papers: the 1981 Trade Union Immunities^[58] and the 1989 Trade
   Unions and their Members.^[59] Both papers outlined concerns regarding
   democracy, rights, and freedom of trade union members; ‘too often in
   recent years it has seemed that employees have been called out on
   strike by their unions without proper consultation and sometimes
   against their express wishes’.^[60] Accordingly, the Thatcher
   government introduced legislation that prior Conservative governments
   were afeard of passing: the Employment Act 1980, Trade Union Act 1984,
   and Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. These
   re-introduced vulnerability and high costs for unions. Under the
   Employment Rights Act 1980, ‘trade-dispute’ was re-defined, statutory
   liabilities were introduced and unions were exposed to injunctions and
   claims for damages. However, upon complying with the stringent
   balloting requirements (from secret ballot to the requirement for all
   ballots to be postal) in the 1984 and 1993 Acts, the dispute would be
   deemed lawful.^[61] It is expensive for unions to comply and evidence
   the fulfilled balloting requirements, but if lawful union members are
   statutorily protected from unfair dismissals and injunctions.^[62]
   While this is a brief summary of the Acts, these restrictive measures
   offer an insight into the Thatcher government’s success in exercising
   its agenda of restricting the lawfulness of industrial action by
   limiting its previously protected scope and purposes.

   Subsequently, the process of placing further controls on trade unions
   continued into the 21^st century.^[63] The 2015 Conservative government
   introduced the ‘draconian’^[64] Trade Union Act 2016 (TUA) – the most
   significant union legislation since the Employment Act 1980. The TUA
   introduced a minimum threshold of eligible members to vote in the
   ballot (at least 50% turnout and 50% voting in favour).^[65] Moreover,
   in the instance the members are engaged in ‘important public
   services’,^[66] 40% of all members entitled to vote must have voted in
   support of the industrial action. These stringent procedural
   requirements have to be strictly followed for a strike to be
   lawful.^[67] Oddly, there was no pressing need to introduce these
   restrictive measures.^[68] There were no significant problems in
   industrial relations at the time (ie, Winter of Discontent) nor any
   significant ‘pressure from business for further laws on strikes’,^[69]
   but the Conservative government justified these 2016 measures through
   the findings of Bruce Carr QC and Ed Holmes.^[70] The Government
   submitted the Carr Review to indicate a consistent pattern of union
   bullying workers, and yet Carr himself ‘did not contend his findings to
   be a sufficient basis’ for influencing the TUA.^[71] Instead, the true
   motivations behind the government’s 2016 legislative programme are
   observed by the ‘striking resemblance’^[72] to Ed Holmes Modernising
   Industrial Relations (MIR) paper.^[73] The policy paper daringly
   questioned the necessity of protecting industrial action by reflecting
   on the development of employment tribunals and discussing the economic
   consequences of strikes. The same ‘free-market economic theory’ that
   underpinned the MIR’s recommendations ‘drove’ the pragmatically
   restrictive and economically influenced 2016 statute developments.^[74]

   The substance of today’s statute in protecting trade unions ‘is far
   removed and much weaker than the position established in 1906’.^[75]
   Since the Henry Campbell-Bannerman leadership, trade union membership
   has declined by more than half due to the ‘three successive
   Conservative governments [who] have enacted labour legislation opposed
   by unions’.^[76] It appears the deep-rooted ideology of the political
   party in power influences the legislative steps for protecting trade
   unions.^[77] Therefore, the extent of the Conservative government’s
   ‘authoritarian, class-biased and oppressive’^[78] industrial action
   policies will be exemplified and ‘more evident than they are today when
   a Labour government is elected again’.^[79]


   Judiciary

   While the likes of Maurice Kay LJ and Lord Neuberger MR ‘characterised
   the statutory immunities as limited exceptions to the common law’ to
   justify interpreting the statute provisions ‘strictly against the trade
   union’, the court’s overall response to industrial action ‘has been
   more mixed’.^[80] The court in Merkur Island Shipping v Laughton^[81]
   developed a three-part test to examine the legality of industrial
   action. This test encapsulates the substantive and procedural
   requirements for a lawful strike whilst observing the intertwined and
   ‘uneasy’ relationship between the common law and statute.^[82] If the
   industrial action is unlawful at common law, the judiciary asks whether
   there is a ‘prime facie statutory immunity’ for the commission of
   torts.^[83] This substantive question considers whether the action was
   ‘in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute’^[84] before
   questioning whether the immunity had been procedurally lost by one of
   the three specified statutory reasons in TULRCA 1992.^[85] The union’s
   partial immunity could be lost for minor ‘inconsequential breaches of
   the statutory rules’^[86]; there is a series of High Court instances of
   injunctions being granted to ‘ever more powerful and well-resourced
   employers’^[87] owing to invalid strike ballots.^[88] The readily
   available labour injunctions continued to be the “key piece^[89]” of
   suppressing collective action until the minor development in 2011.

   In RMT v Serco Ltd; ASLEF v London and Birmingham Railway Limited (RMT
   and ASLEF),^[90] the Court of Appeal approved and applied Millett LJ’s
   1996 observation in London Underground Limited v National Union of
   Railwaymen, Maritime and Transport Staff:^[91] ‘the democratic
   requirement of a secret ballot is not to make life more difficult for
   trade unions … but for the protection of the Union’s own members’.^[92]
   Owing to this proposed democratic aim, the court in RMT and ASLEF
   confirmed it was ‘to interpret the statutory provisions somewhat less
   stringently’.^[93] This interpretation is a stark contrast to Maurice
   Kay LJ’s understanding of parliament’s intentions. The court furthered
   Millett LJ’s aim by recommending a neutral, ‘without presumptions one
   way or the other’,^[94] interpretation of TULRCA. Upon the fact TULRCA
   is premised on the existing common law framework, the court’s ‘judicial
   creativity’ could have easily ‘outflank[ed] the intentions of
   Parliament’.^[95] Instead of a ‘neutral’ approach, the courts have the
   power to mitigate unions disproportionate vulnerability against
   injunctions, damages, and unfair dismissals by encouraging and
   favouring social legitimacy. Although, the RMT and ASLEF court ‘only
   indicated a change in emphasis rather than substance’^[96] (since
   unions are still burdened with the challenges of exercising a ‘lawful’
   strike),^[97] this judgment enhanced union’s ability to resist
   injunction applications (as observed by Balfour Beatty Engineering
   Services Limited v Unite the Union).^[98] The unbiased interpretation
   encouraged in RMT and ASLEF continues to be the leading approach to
   interpreting domestic statutes regarding industrial action.


     * ECHR

   Judiciary

   Admittedly, the scope of Maurice Kay LJ’s strict interpretation was
   narrowly limited by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).^[99]
   The ECtHR confirmed, in Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey,^[100] that
   Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights included
   protection of the right to strike. This Article, and Article 6 of the
   European Social Charter^[101] bestow the right to strike for their
   member states members and due to the UK Human Rights Act 1998, ‘British
   workers are understood to enjoy a right to strike’.^[102] This, unlike
   the mere domestic statutory immunities, is the only instance of a
   ‘legislated’ right to strike in the UK.^[103]

   Under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, ‘statutory provisions
   must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the
   Convention rights’^[104] – ‘the opportunity to test this line of
   argument’^[105] in the English courts arose in Metrobus Ltd v Unite the
   Union (Metrobus).^[106] The Court of Appeal rejected the Enerji
   arguments; the Court denied the authority’s relevance for the
   interpretation of UK statutory provisions. This judgment continues to
   be the leading precedent on the UK’s provisions of Article 11,^[107]
   despite the RMT and ASLEF judgment. In RMT and ASLEF, the UK courts
   acknowledged the ‘clearly protected’^[108] right to strike under ECHR
   Article 11. However, the court emphasised the importance of a ‘fair
   balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual
   and the community as a whole’.^[109] The emphasised interests of the
   ‘community’ motivated the court’s justification for the ban on
   secondary action owing to its ‘potential to … cause broad disruption
   within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the
   public’.^[110] Subsequently, the court confirmed that this ban aligns
   with Article 11(2) ‘on the basis of a wide margin of appreciation
   accorded to the State’.^[111]  While the court is correct to recognise
   their bestowed margin of appreciation, the court rationalised the
   granting of the injunction, ‘which itself cost the union a substantial
   sum’,^[112] upon economic factors. This factor is not only ‘wholly
   irrelevant to the specific facts of the application’ but it disregarded
   and postponed ‘the exercise of what was acknowledged to be a convention
   protected right’.^[113] The court effectively and ‘successfully
   prevented industrial action on the basis of legal’ human rights
   provisions ‘which are intended to benefit workers’.^[114]

   In short, there ‘is no point creating rights’ or passing human rights
   legislation if the ‘court is not prepared to defend them’.^[115] There
   will continue to be an erosion of human rights protection until there
   is greater coordination between the domestic courts and the ECtHR. It
   is credible to conclude that the UK judiciary is more concerned with
   profitability, self-preservation of UK powers, and ‘in appeasing
   political forces’^[116] above the interests of the individuals it and
   the Convention Rights was established to serve.


   Legislature

   The RMT and ASLEF court’s ‘blessing of a wide margin of appreciation’
   in the ‘encompassment’ of Article 11 offered a ‘green light for further
   restrictive legislation on industrial action’ by the ‘only too happy
   Government’.^[117] Here, Boggs and Ewing detect ‘the crude politics of
   power’.^[118] Upon observing the Court of Appeal’s reluctance to
   exercise EU conventions, and the UK courts’ developments that continue
   to be ‘very much in line with the political approach of the
   Conservative government’,^[119] it materialises that the court and
   government are not ‘looking to open a third (ECtHR) front’.^[120]

   The Government has recently launched an ‘independent review’ of the
   Human Rights Act.[121] The review aims to evaluate ‘the duty to take
   into account’ ECtHR case law and assess ‘whether dialogue between our
   domestic courts and the ECtHR works effectively and if there is room
   for improvement’.^[122] It is worth highlighting that this
   ‘independent’ review will be led by former Court of Appeal Judge, Sir
   Peter Gross – the same judge who remarked that ‘the more that
   controversial areas are “outsourced” … the greater the challenge for …
   judicial leadership’.^[123] The former judge is a notable advocate for
   greater domestic judicial leadership.^[124] This advocacy hints the
   likelihood of the review condemning the relevance and precedence of the
   ECtHR (and Human Rights Act 1998) in ‘controversial’ matters such as
   industrial action. This review has the powerful ability to eliminate
   the only instance of a legislated right to strike in the UK.^[125]


   Ultimately

   ‘The notion of lawful industrial action is restrictive’, the procedural
   requirements are ‘onerous’ and the consequences of unions liability for
   unlawful strikes are ‘serious’.^[126] Nearly two decades after the
   European Social Charter’s review,^[127] the UK still does not guarantee
   the right to strike. The precedent in Metrobus still stands. There
   continues to be a ‘poorly reasoned and barely consistent’ series of
   judgments ‘by what looks like a weak, timid’^[128] and politically
   influenced^[129] judiciary. The enactment of the ‘Human Rights Act and
   the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR’^[130] will not prescribe a
   right to strike in the UK until the Supreme Court or ECtHR rule UK’s
   current provisions as incompatible with Article 11.

   In truth, ‘the right to strike [in the UK] has never been much more
   than a slogan or a legal metaphor’.^[131] This ‘slogan’ is a regime of
   immunities that are purposely designed upon an overly complex and
   expensive statutory system.^[132] These immunities are not adequately
   or proportionately protecting workers, unions, and one in nine
   vulnerable, precarious workers against the ‘pitfalls’^[133] of damages,
   injunctions, and unfair dismissals.^[134] This system was successfully
   underlined with the political agenda of deterring trade disputes; the
   UK’s worker strike total has fallen to its ‘lowest level since
   1893’.^[135]  The ‘unanimous and hostile’^[136] approach of the
   legislature and the judiciary towards industrial action exhibits the
   UK’s covert ‘culture of routinely disregarding’^[137] social legitimacy
   in favour of profits.
