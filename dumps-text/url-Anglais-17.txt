                            In the old days, to my commonplace and
                            unobserving mind, he gave no evidences of
                            genius whatsoever. He never read me any of his
                            manuscripts, […], and therefore my lack of
                            detection of his promise may in some degree be
                            pardoned. But he had then none of the oddities
                            and mannerisms which I hold to be inseparable
                            from genius, and which struck my attention in
                            after days when I came in contact with the
                            Celebrity.

         5. (intransitive) To stop working as a protest to achieve better

                            helped the inefficients to set the looms. The
                            other weavers thought this was a breach of

                 Life in the Northern Territory of South Australia, page
                 227:

                            It appears that a compositor had been engaged
                            for the Northem Territory Times, and for a
                            considerable time the editor seems to have led
                            a comparatively unruffled existence; till in
                            an evil hour the compositor was smitten with
                            gold fever, and struck work.

                            I fancied at first the stuff was paraffin wax,
                            and smashed the jar accordingly. But the odor
                            of camphor was unmistakable. It struck me as
                            singularly odd, that among the universal
                            decay, this volatile substance had chanced to
                            survive, perhaps through many thousand years.

         8. (transitive) To create an impression.

                      The news struck a sombre chord.

                 483591931, page 249:

                            The story struck the depressingly familiar
                            note with which true stories ring in the tried
                            ears of experienced policemen. No one queried
                            it. It was in the classic pattern of human
                            weakness, mean and embarrassing and sad.

         9. (sports) To score a goal.
               o 2010 December 28, Marc Vesty, “Stoke 0-2 Fulham”, in BBC:

                 York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1903, lines 141–144, page
                 159:

                            Court-virtues bear, like gems, the highest
                            rate, / Born where Heav'n's influence scarce
                            can penetrate. / In life's low vale, the soil
                            the virtues like, / They please as beauties,
                            here as wonders strike.

                      of path that, I cal'lated, might lead to the road I
                      was hunting for. It twisted and turned, and, the
                      first thing I knew, made a sudden bend around a

Usage notesEdit

     * Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English: "In everyday English,
       people usually say hit rather than strike."
     * The simple past is almost always struck, but it is often avoided by
       using the verb hit (even more than in other tenses) or other verbs
       and expressions. This is especially true in the sense of stopped
       working in protest, about which many native speakers have strong
       opinions concerning the use or appropriateness of struck or
       striked. These strong opinions and criticism of different usage by
       other people are partly due to regional differences but mostly due
       to the verb actually being essentially defective (not used in all
       tenses) in this sense, although apparently no dictionary except
       Wiktionary mentions this. The expressions workers went on strike
       and workers were on strike are much more common than workers struck
       and workers striked, which sound weird, dated, or wrong to many
       native speakers.
     * The past participle is usually struck (e.g. He'd struck it rich, or
       When the clock had struck twelve, etc.). The form stricken is
       significantly rarer. However, it is still found in the sense of "to
       delete, cross out", as in The Court has stricken the statement from
       the record. Moreover, it is used in the passive in the sense of
       "afflicted", as in The city was stricken with/by disease. In other
       contexts it is literary or archaic.

                      The dawn of the oil age was fairly recent. Although
                      the stuff was used to waterproof boats in the Middle
                      East 6,000 years ago, extracting it in earnest began
                      only in 1859 after an oil strike in Pennsylvania.
                      The first barrels of crude fetched $18 (around $450

                      I must admit that my focus was divided, which
                      limited my fishing success. I made a few casts, then
                      arranged my inanimate subjects and took photos. When
                      my indicator went down on my first strike, I cleanly
                      missed the hook up.
