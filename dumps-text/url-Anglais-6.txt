Is there a right to strike in the UK?

   There is no right to strike under UK law. However, under Article 11 of
   the European Convention on Human Rights, everyone has the right to
   freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others,
   including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection
   of their interests. This right can be restricted by law, but only so
   far as is necessary in a democratic society, e.g. for the protection of
   security or public safety, or the prevention of crime. Violent protest
   is not protected.

   Industrial action, including strike action, is legal and protected if
   it follows the rules laid down in the Trade Union and Labour Relations
   (Consolidation) Act 1992, which should be interpreted in line with
   Article 11 ECHR. The rules for legal industrial action include
   requiring the balloting of trade union members before action, and the
   reasonable notification of both the ballot and industrial action to
   employers.

   The law protects workers who are peacefully protesting, communicating
   or persuading people to abstain from working at or near their
   workplace, subject to certain limits such as limits on the numbers of
   pickets. The Act does not allow for employees to be ‘compelled’ to work
   by a court order. ‘Secondary’ or ‘sympathy’ strikes (i.e. striking
   against employer A in sympathy with a group working for employer B) is
   not protected under UK law. Any violence, intimidation or harm to
   persons or property is also not protected.

   The 1992 Act applies across England, Wales and Scotland and partially
   in Northern Ireland. The Act was intended to define and govern the role
   of trade unions, including collective bargaining (i.e. the negotiation
   of conditions of employment by a group of employees) and industrial
   action. It also outlines rights of trade union members, including the
   right not to be denied access to the courts, not to be unjustifiably
   disciplined, and to terminate membership of a union.
