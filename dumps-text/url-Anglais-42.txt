   Blog by Anna Warren, Children's Human Rights Network Committee Member


   On Friday the 12th of April over one million children all over the
   world took to the streets for the second time. We were united over one
   issue: the lack of government action on the climate crisis.

   We are scared and uncertain about our future and refuse to sit back and
   watch our government simply ignore this issue that will fundamentally
   shape our adult lives. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
   states that we have a right to a healthy and clean environment, a right
   to be listened to and the right to be taken seriously.

   Yet, we are not listened to.

   We are not taken seriously.

   We are sick and we are tired of being excluded and ignored by
   a democratic system to which we have no access.

   We refuse to sit back while our politicians deprive us of our rights.

   As we strike from school, we demand that our politicians put future
   generations before party political gain.


   Evie,15, Balfron High School

   The youth are the leaders of tomorrow. We are the ones taking action
   and seemingly some of the few who care. I went to the Climate Strike in
   Glasgow because I am not taken seriously, not heard or listened to by
   those who have power to make the decisions. The adults deem the youth
   as irresponsible, reckless and selfish. Call it a ‘stage’ and that we
   are ‘acting out’.

   We are acting out. But not for irresponsible and reckless reasons.

   We are acting out for the future of our planet. As horrible as it is to
   admit, climate change is an issue that has been ignored for much too
   long and only ultimately futile efforts have been made to mitigate the
   issue. Now the youth are taking action and demanding climate justice
   for our future. We are demanding an earth to still be there for our
   future generations.

   Many people think our protests are making no difference. They think we
   are throwing our lives away by skipping school. I hope in years to come
   these doubters look around and see the future generations thanking
   those who took the risk and voiced their concerns about the future of
   the planet. Standing up to climate change is something we won’t regret,
   what we will regret is if we don’t act quickly enough. The youth
   climate strike was a safe, peaceful and wonderful protest, one I will
   not forget for years to come and certainly not one I will regret.


   Emil, 16, Williamwood High School.

   I've been waiting for a movement like this ever since I first learned
   what climate change is. The Youth strike movement is a great step in
   the right direction and is just the kind of revolution we need. In
   recent years, I've become extremely disenchanted with the state of
   politics, with the youth voice consistently ignored and our futures put
   in jeopardy in the name of profits. Since the protest, seeing how many
   like-minded individuals my age there are out there, I'm beginning to
   feel a sense of hope again. But I'll never be truly satisfied until the
   government listens to us and declares a state of climate emergency.

While you’re here…

   People in Ukraine are facing a catastrophic human rights crisis. The
   Russian invasion has led to many civilian deaths and mass displacement.
   We're urging governments across Europe – including in the UK – to
   ensure anyone fleeing Ukraine is given protection without
   discrimination. Our crisis investigators are on the ground to document
   human rights abuses as they happen. Amnesty International UK's vital
   work depends on the generosity of our supporters to fund our ongoing
   fight for human rights. Your donation, however big or small, is
   valuable.

   If you can, please chip in today to help put humanity first and protect
   human rights. Thank you.
