   Thousands of ambulance service staff including paramedics and
   call-handlers in the north west - hundreds in total across Greater
   Manchester - are due to walk out on strike on Wednesday in the biggest
   collective industrial action for 30 years.

   But as hospital bosses issue urgent warnings to the public over
   ʼunprecedented conditionsʼ at A&E departments following images of
   stacked up ambulances outside, combined with the usual pressures of
   winter sickness bugs, Strep A alarm and the nursing strike, the action
   will undoubtedly leave households worried about what to do in the event
   of an emergency - and what urgent care they will receive should the
   worst happen.

   As talks between unions and the Government appeared to end without
   agreement tonight, North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) - one of 10 of
   11 ambulance trusts in England and Wales set to be impacted - has said
   it will ʼuse military support where appropriateʼ, although no further
   details have been provided, after urging patients with less serious
   conditions to take taxis to hospital or get lifts in from friends and
   family.

       patients canʼt be kept safe during strikes

   Unions claimed tonight the health secretary, Steve Barclay, refused to
   discuss pay during eleventh hour meetings. Saying their demands were
   ʼunaffordableʼ after a four per cent rise was rejected, he later
   tweeted: "I hugely value the work of our NHS staff and itʼs
   disappointing some union members are going ahead with further strike
   action - my door remains open to further talks.

   "Unions have called for industrial action to cause maximum disruption
   and inevitably this will have an impact. My priority remains patient
   safety. We have contingency plans in place and I have met with
   ambulance union reps today urging them to honour their commitment to
   provide responses to life-threatening emergency calls. People should
   come forward for emergency care and attend appointments unless
   contacted.

   "Ultimately union demands are unaffordable during these challenging
   times but as I’ve said before, I’m open to engaging with unions on how
   to make the NHS a better place to work."

   Unisonʼs Christina McAnea said she was ʼvery disappointedʼ strike
   action would definitely go ahead on Wednesday after talks brought ʼno
   movement, saying of the Health Secretary: "He has an envelope and he
   will take back our concerns to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor.
   So no movement and the strike is definitely on tomorrow."

   Senior hospital clinicians in Manchester, meanwhile, are concerned
   about knock-on effects on departments, as patient transport services -
   the moving of patients to hospitals and healthcare settings from home -
   will only prioritise people attending cancer, renal and palliative care
   appointments.

   One NHS source in Manchester said they were also concerned about
   ʼinter-hospital transfersʼ and predicted Thursday, the day after the
   strike, would be the ʼworst dayʼ. They told the Manchester Evening News
   : "I am also concerned about time-critical treatments - if youʼve got a
   patient who needs neurosurgery in your emergency department and you are
   not a neurosurgical unit."

   The NHS admitted it was facing ʼrecord demand on urgent and emergency
   care servicesʼ, with October and November said to have been the busiest
   on record for A&E attendances and serious ambulance callouts, as it
   confirmed patients whose conditions are not life-threatening would have
   to wait longer than usual for an ambulance ʼand where safe and
   appropriate may be asked to make their own way to hospitalʼ.

   Heath service bosses also urged the public to ʼdrink responsiblyʼ to
   avoid ending up in A&E, with a health minister going as far as urging
   people to avoid any ʼrisky activityʼ.

   NHS Medical Director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said: "There is no
   doubt that the NHS is facing extreme pressure and industrial action
   will add to the already record demand we are seeing on urgent and
   emergency care, and so it is really important that the public play
   their part by using services wisely. This means continuing to call 999
   for life-threatening emergencies – if it is not life-threatening you
   may have to wait longer than usual for an ambulance.

   "And using 111 online for other health needs where you will receive
   clinical advice on the best next steps to take."

   NWAS has already warned its staff there will be ʼa significant and
   noticeable difference in the way we operateʼ and said ʼconfirmedʼ cases
   of cardiac arrests and ʼimmediate threats to lifeʼ would continue to
   attract an ambulance response. If A&E attendance is required for
   anything else, ʼimmediate self-conveyance or taxi conveyance will be
   advisedʼ, said a leaked memo.

   Members of three unions are involved, GMB, Unite and Unison, and the
   M.E.N. understands as many as 20 picket lines are planned for tomorrow,
   Wednesday, with the majority of them outside ambulance stations.
   Timings of the picket lines vary between unions.

   So called ʼlife and limb coverʼ will be provided, unions have
   confirmed, but no exact details have been revealed. The exact
   arrangements were still being thrashed out between unions and local
   ambulance trust leaders tonight, believed to be based an population
   size.

   During the strike, military personnel are not expected to drive
   ambulances on blue lights for the most serious calls, but are expected
   to provide support on other calls. Itʼs thought around 600 members of
   the armed forces are due to step in.

   Talks between unions and ambulance services are ongoing to work out
   which incidents should be exempt from strike action. It is expected
   that all category one calls – the most life-threatening, such as
   cardiac arrest – will be responded to.

   Some ambulance trusts have agreed exemptions with unions for specific
   incidents within so-called category two, which covers serious
   conditions such as stroke or chest pain. However, NHS sources have said
   they doubt whether an elderly person who falls at home would be covered
   by the arrangements, meaning potentially an ambulance would not arrive
   to treat them.

   In its latest update, NWAS clarified the arrangements so far. It said
   in a statement: "Ambulances will still be available to respond,
   although they will be prioritised for life-threatening injuries and
   illnesses. Typical emergencies include cardiac arrest, loss of
   consciousness, fits that aren’t stopping, breathing difficulties,
   severe bleeding or allergic reactions and serious head injuries.

   "If they require hospital treatment, patients should also consider
   taking alternative transport such as a taxi or getting a lift from
   family or friends. Equally, they should use 111.nhs.uk their GP or
   local pharmacy for help with non-urgent health concerns."

   Paramedic leaders, however, have voiced concerns over patients whose
   conditions deteriorate - moving them up a category of seriousness - and
   said they fear delays could persist after the strike action has
   finished.

   Dr John Martin, president of the College of Paramedics, said patients
   experienced long delays on Tuesday and they would likely worsen during
   industrial action on Wednesday.

   He told the Health and Social Care select committee: "I donʼt think
   safety is black and white. Itʼs not one or the other. Right now today
   we’re seeing long delays for patients. There are lots of patients
   waiting at the moment for an ambulance response. On Wednesday, even
   with the derogations, thatʼs likely to be worse. But with this life and
   limb cover, paramedics up and down the country will absolutely want to
   keep patients safe.

   "I think the important bit to note in that though is that the Category
   1 calls - the ones that come in at the time that look like they’re life
   and limb - they will get a response and the unions are working very
   hard on how that will occur.

   "Itʼs the group in Category 2 and below who maybe donʼt start off as
   life or limb, and this is what weʼre seeing today and likely on
   Wednesday, who will deteriorate over time and eventually they will
   become a life or limb emergency and obviously at that point they do
   fall into Category 1."

   He added: “That’s happening today right now before we even get to
   industrial action on Wednesday.”

   Prof Julian Redhead, national clinical director for urgent and
   emergency care at NHS England, told MPs that stand-by ambulance
   services on Wednesday would be focused on the most serious cases.

   "I think the what we’ve done is to concentrate with our unions to make
   sure that we have the services available for those sickest and most
   vulnerable patients to have the response that they require. And those
   in general will be in category 1 and category 2 call out categories."

   Ged Blezard, Director of Operations at NWAS, said: "We have tried and
   tested plans to manage any disruption, including industrial action,
   however, itʼs important to understand there will be an impact on the
   public.

   "We want you to continue to ring 999 if you are in a life-threatening
   situation. However, we are advising patients, that they should consider
   other forms of transport if they still need to go to a hospital. We are
   maximising our own resources, using private providers and military
   support where appropriate and working closely with our Trade Unions to
   provide cover for the most serious emergencies. We are also working
   with our healthcare partners to maintain patient safety during these
   periods of industrial action."

   "Also, if you have already called 999 to request an ambulance, please
   only call back if your condition has worsened or to cancel the
   ambulance. Repeatedly calling 999 can block phone lines for other
   emergencies. If you need urgent care – use the symptom checker at NHS
   111 online, which will direct you to the most appropriate support.
   Again, you should call on friends or relatives for transport if
   necessary."

   Mr Barclay said people should call an ambulance if there was a need to
   do so during the strike on Wednesday ʼbut there will be impacts on
   patientsʼ.

   Asked whether ambulances would be available to an elderly person who
   fell and broke their hip, Mr Barclay said: "The advice is if there is a
   need to call an ambulance people should continue to do so. And of
   course GPs continue to be open and where people have an appointment,
   they should continue to attend those unless they were advised not to do
   so.

   "So people should continue to call 999 where they need an ambulance.
   But there will be impacts on patients as a result of the strike action.

   Health Minister Will Quince told anyone with chest pains on Wednesday
   to call 999 despite the strike action by ambulance workers. "If you
   have chest pains, then phone 999. If it is not life-threatening, then
   it’s really important that people call NHS 111 or NHS 111 online,” he
   told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

   Asked if having chest pains is an emergency and that a patient could
   get an ambulance, Mr Quince said: "If you have chest pains, call 999
   and the expectation is, and I’ve been really clear with you, I don’t
   think that there is any paramedic, ambulance technician, anyone working
   in our NHS, whether they’re on a picket line or not, that would not
   respond to a 999 call where somebody has chest pains and there is a
   threat of a heart attack.

   "Call 999, a clinician will assess that call and then consider the
   appropriate action whether that’s an ambulance, whether itʼs community
   services, whether it’s NHS 111."
