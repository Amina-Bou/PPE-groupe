   Responding to the collapse of last ditch talks between GMB and Glasgow
   City Council tonight, resulting in strike action across the city’s
   cleansing service from 00.01 hours tomorrow, GMB Scotland Secretary
   Louise Gilmour said:

   “We met the council in good faith, offering a clear set of proposals to
   reset industrial relations and avoid strikes. The council rejected
   these proposals.

   “We specifically offered heads of terms to work together to tackle the
   chronic and unacceptable problems caused by years of cuts, to urgently
   address the employer’s unresolved discriminatory pay system and
   outstanding equal pay liabilities, and back this with a commitment from
   the council that they would not use anti-trade union laws
   against their workers again.

   “We also proposed the Scottish Government support this process, because
   if the fair work agenda is to have any credibility whatsoever, then
   Scotland’s biggest city should be the example of it rather than the
   opposite.

   “Regrettably, the council refused this massive opportunity to move
   forward and strike action across the cleansing service will now begin,
   during which time our members will be balloted on the COSLA pay
   offer.”

     BREAKING: Glasgow #COP26 refuse and cleansing strike to go ahead.
     Glasgow City Council has acted in bad faith and failed to give our
     members proper time and space to discuss the 11th hour offer from
     COSLA.
     Strike action will commence from midnight.https://t.co/zEZAyJR46a
