The London Tube strike 'brought economic benefits for workers'

   PolicyResearch

   New analysis of the London Tube strike in February 2014 finds that it
   enabled a sizeable fraction of commuters to find better routes to work,
   and actually produced a net economic benefit due to the number of
   people who found more efficient ways to get to work.

    The researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of
   Cambridge analysed 20 days’ worth of anonymised Oyster card data,
   containing more than 200 million data points, in order to see how
   individual Tube journeys changed during the strike. Since this
   particular strike only resulted in a partial closure of the Tube
   network and not all commuters were affected by the strike, a direct
   comparison was possible. The data enabled the researchers to see
   whether people chose to go back to their normal commute once the strike
   was over, or if they found a more efficient route and decided to
   switch.

    The researchers found that of the regular commuters affected by the
   strike, either because certain stations were closed or because travel
   times were considerably different, a significant fraction – about one
   in 20 – decided to stick with their new route once the strike was over.

    While the proportion of individuals who ended up changing their routes
   may sound small, the researchers found that the strike actually ended
   up producing a net economic benefit. By performing a cost-benefit
   analysis of the amount of time saved by those who changed their daily
   commute, the researchers found that the amount of time saved in the
   longer term actually outweighed the time lost by commuters during the
   strike.

    The London Tube map itself may have been a reason why many commuters
   did not find their optimal journey before the strike. In many parts of
   London, the actual distances between stations are distorted on the
   iconic map. By digitising the Tube map and comparing it to the actual
   distances between stations, the researchers found that those commuters
   living in, or travelling to, parts of London where distortion is
   greatest were more likely to have learned from the strike and found a
   more efficient route.  Additionally, since different Tube lines travel
   at different speeds, those commuters who had been travelling on one of
   the slower lines were also more likely to switch routes once the strike
   was over.

    'One of the things we’re looking at is whether consumers usually make
   the best decision, but it’s never been empirically tested using a large
   consumer dataset such as this one,' said co-author Dr Ferninand Rauch
   from Oxford’s Department of Economics. 'Our findings illustrate that
   people might get stuck with suboptimal decisions because they don’t
   experiment enough.'

   'Given that a significant fraction of commuters on the London
   underground failed to find their optimal route until they were forced
   to experiment, perhaps we should not be too frustrated that we can’t
   always get what we want, or that others sometimes take decisions for
   us,' said co-author Dr Tim Willems, also from Oxford’s Department of
   Economics. 'If we behave anything like London commuters and experiment
   too little, hitting such constraints may very well be to our long-term
   advantage.'

    According to the authors, being forced to alter a routine, whether
   that’s due to a Tube strike or government regulation, can often lead to
   net benefits, as people or corporations are forced to innovate. In
   economics, this is known as the Porter hypothesis.

    'For the small fraction of commuters who found a better route, when
   multiplied over a longer period of time, the benefit to them actually
   outweighs the inconvenience suffered by many more,' said co-author Dr
   Shaun Larcom of Cambridge’s Department of Land Economy. 'The net gains
   came from the disruption itself.'
