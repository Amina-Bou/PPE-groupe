   The voice of 8 million European public service workers

The right to strike - country factsheets

   banner strike2

   The right to strike varies considerably across Europe, often with
   specific rules and restrictions imposed on public service workers. The
   European Trade Union Institute has produced 35 country factsheets that
   explain the latest legal situation. EPSU has also begun to add
   countries outside the European Union and candidate countries and a
   total of 48 countries are now covered.

   Each factsheet sets out the main legal basis for the right to strike,
   indicating which international standards the country has signed up to.
   It then runs through the main rules covering:
     * who has the right to call a strike,
     * definition of a strike,
     * who may participate in a strike,
     * procedural requirements, and
     * legal consequences of participating in a strike.

   The factsheet then looks at the case law of international and European
   bodies, including in particular the International Labour Organisation
   and Council of Europe.
