When are the train strikes and why are they taking place?

   Rail passengers are being advised not to travel, as unions hold further
   strikes as part of a long-running dispute.

   Industrial action is being taken in a dispute over pay, job security
   and working conditions.

When are the next train strikes taking place?

   The RMT rail workers' union has announced strikes on:
     * Tuesday and Wednesday, 3-4 January
     * Friday and Saturday, 6-7 January

   Previous strikes by the RMT have had a major impact on services
   throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Passengers should check their
   train-operating company's website and only travel if absolutely
   necessary.

   Network Rail - which owns and maintains rails, signals and stations -
   says half of rail lines will be shut. Most of Scotland and Wales will
   have no trains running. Significant disruption is also likely on
   non-strike days.

   In addition, the train drivers' union, Aslef, has called a strike on 5
   January.

   Its action will affect operations across 15 rail companies:
     * Avanti West Coast
     * Chiltern Railways
     * CrossCountry
     * East Midlands Railway
     * Great Western Railway
     * Greater Anglia
     * GTR Great Northern Thameslink
     * London North Eastern Railway
     * Northern Trains
     * Southeastern
     * Southern/Gatwick Express
     * South Western Railway
     * SWR Island Line
     * TransPennine Express
     * West Midlands Trains

   Workers on London's Elizabeth Line are also due to strike on January
   12.

Why have railway workers been on strike?

   The unions are in dispute with the government and rail companies about
   pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.

   Unions say any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living.

   But the rail industry is under pressure to save money, after the
   pandemic left a hole in its finances. Bosses say reforms need to be
   agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.

   Network Rail is planning to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the
   way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could
   be achieved by people leaving voluntarily.

   The RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no
   compulsory job losses.

What deal have rail workers been offered?

   Network Rail made an offer of a 5% pay rise this year and a 4% pay rise
   in 2023.

   But RMT union boss Mick Lynch described the deal as "substandard" and
   its members have rejected it.

   The union also rejected an offer from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) -
   which represents train companies. That included a pay increase of up to
   8% over two years and a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies until
   April 2024.

   In exchange, it wanted repurposing or closure of ticket offices and
   Sunday working.

   The RDG offer is separate to negotiations with Network Rail, which
   employs about half the workers in the dispute.

How much are rail workers paid?

   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated the average
   salary of rail workers in 2022 was £45,919, based on five different job
   categories.

   If drivers are excluded, its estimate is £39,518.

   The RMT said that figure was still too high because it excluded rail
   cleaning staff who are not categorised as rail workers by the ONS.
