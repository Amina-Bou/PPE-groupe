Biggest ever university strikes set to hit UK campuses over pay, conditions &
pensions

   8 November 2022

   Over 70,000 university staff at 150 universities will strike for three
   days later this month over attacks on pay, working conditions and
   pensions. The National Union of Students (NUS) has backed the strikes,
   which will be the biggest ever to hit UK universities and could impact
   2.5 million students.

   UCU said disruption can be avoided if employers act fast and make
   improved offers. If they don't, strike action will escalate in the New
   Year alongside a marking and assessment boycott.

   The full strike dates in November are:
     * Thursday 24 November
     * Friday 25 November
     * Wednesday 30 November.

   Staff will also begin industrial action short of strike action from
   Wednesday 23 November, which includes working to rule, refusing to make
   up work lost as a result of strike action and refusing to cover for
   absent colleagues.

   The strikes come after UCU members overwhelmingly voted 'yes'
   to industrial action last month in two historic national ballots over
   attacks on pay and working conditions as well as pension cuts. Despite
   the result, vice-chancellors have not made any improved offers.

   In the pay and working conditions dispute, the union's demands include
   a meaningful pay rise to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and action
   to end the use of insecure contracts. Employers imposed a pay rise
   worth just 3% this year following over a decade of below inflation pay
   awards. A third of academic staff are on some form of temporary
   contract.

   In the pension dispute, UCU is demanding employers revoke the cuts and
   restore benefits. The package of cuts made earlier this year will see
   the average member lose 35% from their guaranteed future retirement
   income. For those at the beginning of their careers the losses are in
   the hundreds of thousands of pounds.

   The UK university sector generated record income of £41.1bn last year
   with vice chancellors collectively earning an estimated £45million. UCU
   said the sector can more than afford to meet staff demands.

   UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: 'Campuses across the UK are about
   to experience strike action on a scale never seen before. 70,000 staff
   will walk out and make clear they refuse to accept falling pay, cuts to
   pensions and insecure employment.

   'This is not a dispute about affordability - it is about choices.
   Vice-chancellors are choosing to pay themselves hundreds of thousands
   of pounds whilst forcing our members onto low paid and insecure
   contracts that leave some using foodbanks. They choose to hold billions
   in surpluses whilst slashing staff pensions.

   'UCU members do not want to strike but are doing so to save the sector
   and win dignity at work. This dispute has the mass support of students
   because they know their learning conditions are our members' working
   conditions.

   'If university vice-chancellors don't get serious, our message is
   simple - this bout of strike action will be just the beginning.'

   NUS vice president higher education Chloe Field said: 'Students stand
   in solidarity with the 70,000 university staff across the UK who will
   strike later this month. Staff teaching conditions are students'
   learning conditions, and we must fight together for a fairer, healthier
   education system for everyone who works and studies.

   'This is the fifth year in a row that government cuts to education and
   workers' rights have resulted in strike action on our campuses. In that
   time, staff and students have stood together in the fight for better
   pay and conditions for all university staff, including the thousands of
   postgraduate students on increasingly casualised contracts.

   'The struggles we face as students are inextricably linked to the
   reasons that staff are striking. High rents, astronomical international
   student fees, and cuts to maintenance support have happened for the
   same reasons that staff are suffering under huge workloads - the failed
   marketisation of the sector which has put profit above staff and
   student well-being.

   'Universities and employers must come to the table and take meaningful
   action to end these disputes. They have a responsibility to their staff
   and students to end unacceptable pay disparities for racialised staff,
   disabled staff, and women, and to protect staff pensions to that they
   can have a decent retirement. As the workers of the future, students
   have everything to gain from UCU members winning this fight.'
