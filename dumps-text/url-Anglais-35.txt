   Flying Flying

   Airline strikes are, at best, inconvenient. At their worst, they could
   upend all your plans or cost you and your loved ones considerable
   amounts of money.

   If your flight is delayed or cancelled due to strikes, you may be
   eligible for compensation. This is thanks to EU Reg 261 and UK
   equivalent (Flight Compensation Regulation), which protects passengers
   whose flights are delayed or cancelled.

   In this guide, we’ll discuss the different kinds of strikes affecting
   flights, your rights as a passenger, and what to do if your plans
   change.

Compensation for cancelled flights due to industrial action

   Before we discuss your rights as a passenger, it’s important to
   understand the distinction between monetary compensation and
   refunds/alternative routes.

   In the event of strikes, under EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent you could
   be eligible for a combination of:
     * Reasonable care and assistance
     * Alternative flights to your destination
     * A full refund for your ticket

   In some circumstances, you might also be entitled to financial
   compensation. This is relative to the length of the delay and the
   distance, and is offered on top of everything else you can claim in
   some cases.

What are my rights if I’m affected by wildcat strikes?

   Wildcat strikes gained widespread media attention in 2016 after a
   multi-million-pound case was brought to the European Court of Justice.
   The case, Helga Krüsemann and Others v TUIfly GmbH, ruled that
   passengers could now claim for cancellations or delays for “wildcat”
   strikes.

   The term “wildcat strike” refers to a strike launched by airline staff
   at the last minute, as opposed to a strike that has been planned in
   advance.


Can you claim for a flight cancelled due to Air Traffic Control?

   The subject of Air Traffic Control strikes is a contentious one, with
   Air France strike compensation claims coming up time and again. In May
   2019 alone, there were 5,000 flights affected by strikes.

   Strictly speaking, Air Traffic Control should not ground flights for
   any reasons other than passenger safety, for example in freak weather.
   However, this is not always the case.

   In the case of Air Traffic Control strikes, your rights to refunds and
   care and assistance would be the same. However, it’s unlikely you’ll
   receive any monetary compensation as the airline will deem this an
   “extraordinary circumstance”.



What are my rights if there are airline crew strikes?

   According to the Civil Aviation Authority, you may be able to claim if
   airline employees call a strike.

   You will only be eligible for compensation if you meet the criteria of
   EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent, e.g. checking in on time and flying from
   the EU or UK or arriving into the EU or UK on an EU or UK airline. With
   cancelled flights, you may only claim if you found out about the
   cancellation because of strikes less than two weeks before your flight.

What are my rights if baggage handlers or airport staff strike?

   Flight strike compensation claims are very much dependent on who calls
   the strike. When it comes to baggage handlers or airport staff, the law
   is not 100% clear and it’s likely that these claims would need to go to
   court for a judge to decide.

   The airline may argue that these strikes are ‘extraordinary’ and refuse
   to pay compensation as a result. This can make it difficult for
   passengers to claim any monetary compensation, which is one of the
   reasons we set up our claims service.

   Even if the delay or cancellation is considered extraordinary, you’re
   still entitled to an alternative flight or a refund, providing the
   delay/cancellation meets the EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent criteria.



What are my rights if my flights are delayed by strikes?

   Under EU Reg 261 and UK equivalent, you may be able to claim monetary
   compensation if your flight is delayed by 3 hours or more. This applies
   to flights on any airline taking off from an EU or UK airport, or
   flights with an EU or UK carrier landing in the EU or UK.

   You can expect reasonable care and assistance at the airport for delays
   (see below). You may not be able to claim monetary compensation,
   however, if the airline claims “extraordinary circumstances”. This
   include extreme weather, political instability, or safety/security
   risks.

   You may also be able to claim if a strike has a knock-on effect on your
   flight. For example, if a strike happened the day before your flight
   and was lifted the day after, you could claim compensation for any
   resulting delays.



What are my rights if my flight is cancelled due to strikes?

   Your airline must offer you a full refund if your flight is cancelled,
   regardless of when they informed you. You also have the right to ask
   for a rerouted flight, or if you’re transferring, a flight back to your
   departure destination.

   Again, you will not be able to claim monetary compensation for
   extraordinary circumstances. However, the European Court has ruled that
   strikes called by airline staff are within the airline’s control.
   Therefore, they should offer you monetary compensation in addition to
   the above.

What care and assistance can I get at the airport?

   After a delay of 2 hours or more (including if you are waiting only to
   be told your flight is cancelled), it is your airline’s obligation to
   provide adequate care and assistance. This might be provided in
   vouchers for food and drink, but if you don’t receive any, keep your
   receipts and claim these back.

   Generally, your airline should offer you a “reasonable amount of food
   and drink” relative to your waiting time, plus two phone calls, emails
   or faxes. For delays of 5 hours of more, you can get a refund or ask
   for alternative transportation, or even stay in overnight accommodation
   if relevant.


   Flight distance Delay How the airline will help
   Up to 3,500km 2-4 hours Food and drink plus two phone calls, emails or
   faxes.
   All flights 5+ hours Food and drink plus two phone calls, emails or
   faxes. Opportunity to withdraw from flight with full reimbursement and
   alternative transportation.
   All flights Following day Overnight accommodation in a nearby hotel
   with transport to and from the airport.

What should my airline do if a strike is imminent?

   It is your airline’s responsibility to notify you of imminent strikes
   as soon as possible. However, you can only make additional monetary
   claims if you find out less than 14 days in advance, and there are no
   “extraordinary circumstances”.

   Your airline should be prepared to offer you a full refund or
   alternative flight.


What should I do if industrial action is planned?

   If you have written confirmation of a proposed strike, you should make
   the following arrangements:
     * Book a replacement flight: only do this if you have formal
       confirmation. If you’re not sure, shop around for flights and book
       when the airline confirms. They will refund you for the original
       flight.
     * Cancel flexible flights: if you have a refundable ticket, you may
       wish to refund this rather than processing a claim through the
       airline afterward. Again, wait until you have confirmation.
     * Notify all other booked services: if you still intend to travel,
       let any hotels, rental cars or other booked services know of any
       changes to your plans. Your insurance should cover cancellations.
     * Check your travel insurance: if any booked services tell you your
       booking is non-refundable, you could claim these costs back on
       travel insurance. (Your airline will compensate for the flights.)
       Try to make alternative arrangements first to save time. For
       package holidays, your tour operator can arrange refunds.


Credit cards and Section 75 – your rights

   Under Section 75 of the Consumer Protection Act, your credit card
   provider can protect you if things go wrong. This is why many credit
   cards have fees – they are liable to pay out for anything over the
   value of £100 in undesirable circumstances.

   For example, if you booked you and your family a trip away for a
   wedding, and strikes meant it could not go ahead, the credit card
   company would be liable to pay all associated costs. Similarly, if you
   decide to buy a replacement flight, your credit card company can
   compensate you for the value of this – even if it costs more than the
   original.
