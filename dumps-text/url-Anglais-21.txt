Christmas travel chaos: How will UK Border Force strikes affect passengers?

   Travellers could face 'significant disruption' to their Christmas
   travel plans as UK Border Force workers go on strike over the holiday
   period.

   The industrial action will see more than 1,000 Border Force staff walk
   out on eight days during the busy festive season, from 23 December to
   Boxing Day, and from 28 December to New Year’s Eve.

   This mass strike - conducted by members of The Public and Commercial
   Services Union (PCS) union - will likely delay security checks, causing
   lengthy queues and knock-on disruption. There are fears travellers
   could face passport queues of more than two hours during the festive
   period.

Where in the UK could be the worst affected?

   Larger airports which endured severe disruptions over the summer are
   likely to be worst impacted.

   Passport checks at Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and
   Birmingham will be affected, according to the PCS union. Passengers at
   all other UK airports are unlikely to be impacted.

   Heathrow is expected to be the worst hit. The airport needs to recruit
   and train up to 25,000 security-cleared staff before the festive
   period, a task the airport has described as “a huge logistical
   challenge”.

   “We are supporting, including establishing a recruitment taskforce to
   help fill vacancies, working closely with the government on a review of
   airline ground handling and appointing a senior operational executive
   to invest in joint working,” an airport spokesperson said.

Will there be queues at Gatwick airport?

   Gatwick has said in a statement that it expects flights to operate as
   usual during the strikes. It is advising passengers to check the status
   of their flights and for those with a connection at the airport to
   allow extra time for their onward journey.

Will there be queues at Manchester airport?

   At Manchester Airport, 200 new security staff are being recruited, but
   won't start work until April 2023. The airport has said it expects it
   will be necessary for airlines to cancel some services on strike days
   but it is working with them to ensure passengers are given as much
   notice as possible.

   Border force staff at the port of Newhaven, East Sussex were also
   included in the PCS announcement setting out locations of strikes.

   But workers at other British ports like Dover, Plymouth and Portsmouth
   have not said if they will be taking part. Neither have staff at the
   Channel Tunnel terminal in Folkestone.

   British Border Force staff who operate out of the French port of Calais
   and Eurostar terminal at Gare du Nord in Paris also haven't said if
   they will be involved in the walkout.

   Eurostar passengers should be aware, however, that security staff have
   filed a separate strike notice over the festive period.

How will travellers be impacted by the UK border force strikes?

   More than 10,000 flights carrying up to 2 million passengers are
   expected to arrive at the affected airports between December 23 and 31,
   according to aviation analytics company Cirium.

   "While we are working closely with all UK ports and airports and have
   robust plans in place to minimise any delays if strike action goes
   ahead, passengers should be prepared for their plans to be severely
   disrupted," UK Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said in a statement.

Will it be arrivals or departures that will be most affected?

   Outbound passengers are likely to be largely unaffected but inbound
   travellers should expect long queues at the border. Many airlines and
   airports have vowed to run a full flight schedule despite the
   industrial action.

   Heathrow said on Monday that it expects a majority of passengers will
   be unaffected by the strikes.

   "Departing passengers should expect to travel as normal," the airport
   said in a statement.

   Arriving passengers with British, EU, US, Canadian and some other
   passports will be able to use the e-gates as normal.

   "We are doing everything we can to protect a full flight schedule on
   strike days," the airport said. Passengers have been advised to check
   their flight status before travelling.

   Jet2 operates out of three affected airports - Birmingham, Glasgow and
   Manchester. CEO Steve Heapy said the airline "very much intends" to
   operate its full schedule of Christmas and new year flights - including
   the dates when strike action is taking place.

   "Our customers have worked hard to make precious holiday plans,
   including seeing family and friends, over the festive period," he said
   in a statement.

   "Our teams will work tirelessly to make sure we fly everyone to and
   from their destinations so that they can enjoy those well-deserved
   holidays."

   EasyJet has also said it plans to run its flight schedule as expected.

   A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said that the airline was aware of
   planned strike action and will "continue to work closely with
   government and industry to support contingency planning and minimise
   disruption."

   "Our customers’ journeys over the festive period are our priority and
   we’re focused on supporting their travel plans, keeping them updated on
   any potential disruption at the border."

How is the government planning to reduce disruption?

   More than 1,200 military personnel and 1,000 civil servants are being
   drafted in to carry out border checks and fill in for ambulance workers
   who are also striking over the Christmas period.

   According to the government, they will be trained to fill gaps in
   staffing to "minimise disruption for passengers" and keep frontline
   services running.

   But the head of the armed forces has said that they should not be
   thought of as "spare capacity" for striking workers.

   "We're busy and we're doing lots of things on behalf of the nation -
   we've got to focus on our primary role," chief of defence staff Admiral
   Sir Tony Radakin told the Sunday Telegraph.

   Unions have also warned that military personnel are not properly
   qualified to carry out these jobs. PCS said that Border Force members
   "are specialists in their fields and can't be replaced by people with
   just days of training."

Why are border force officials striking?

   The strike is part of a larger coordinated action by thousands of civil
   servants. 100,000 PCS members in 214 government departments and other
   public bodies voted to take action

   Members are demanding a 10 per cent pay rise, citing eye-watering
   inflation of 10.6 per cent.

   Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said that the strike would
   cause 'significant disruption' - but added that the cost of living
   crisis has left workers  "desperate" with no choice but to strike.

   "We have no option but to take industrial action because our members
   are using food banks and not able to switch on the heating right now,"
   he said.

   "The government can stop these strikes tomorrow if it puts money on the
   table."
