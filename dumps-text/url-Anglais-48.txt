Global Climate Strikes 14 February 2020

   On 14 February 2020, schools may be empty but the streets will be full.
   Young people are calling on everyone to join the climate strikes across
   the country to demand emergency action on climate breakdown.

   Show love for the planet this Valentine's Day by joining or supporting
   the strikes.

Join the strikes

   The climate crisis is happening now with communities across the world,
   who have contributed least to the crisis, feeling the sharpest impacts.

   When we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down from
   filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK,
   and funding oil and gas projects abroad.

   The window to act is closing fast. It's time to stand alongside young
   people fighting for climate justice.

We still have hope

   We still have time to turn things around and secure the ambitious
   action we need to create a greener, fairer world.

   Huge change is possible. In 2019, the UK went coal-free for 18 days.
   That's the longest break since the 1880s, and something that would have
   been unthinkable a few decades ago.

Listen to the School Strikers

   On 20 September 2019 schoolchildren striking against the worsening
   climate crisis were joined by millions of adults for the Global Climate
   Strike.

   Presenter Muna interviews the youth climate activists at the heart of
   the school strikes just days before the historic event.

   Listen to their story.
