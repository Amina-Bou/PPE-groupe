The 1972 Building Workers’ Strike

   The first national building workers strike was one of a large number of
   industrial disputes in 1972. They included miners, steelworkers, car
   workers and dockers. These disputes had been successful for the unions
   involved and demonstrated the power and effectiveness of collective
   action by trade union members.

   1972 saw the highest number of strike days in Britain since the General
   Strike in 1926. The Tory government called two States of Emergency. The
   first was in February 1972 during the miners’ strike. 15,000 trade
   unionists, including coal miners and local engineering workers closed
   the gates of Saltley coke depot in Birmingham. The second was in August
   1972, during the dockers dispute. The Conservative Government tried to
   use the Industrial Relations Act 1971 to emasculate the unions’ ability
   to defend members’ wages and conditions of employment. Most unions
   refused to recognise the provisions of the Act thus making it
   ineffective.

   It was different for the unions involved in the building dispute. Their
   national strike was unique because it was more difficult for building
   workers unions to organise workers in the industry. Building sites
   were, by their nature, temporary and geographically dispersed. They
   were operated by different employers depending upon which one had won
   the contract for the construction work, whether it was for houses,a
   factory, a hospital or an office block. Each new site often brought
   together a group of workers who had not worked regularly with each
   other and who had to negotiate afresh with the employers over rates of
   pay and conditions of work. Sites where “lump” workers were working
   proved difficult for the union members to organise. The “lumpers”
   weakened the unions’ negotiating strength with the employers.

   On any given building site there were a large number of different
   trades, many in separate, small unions: electricians, carpenters,
   painters & decorators, plasterers, bricklayers, plumbers, labourers,
   scaffolders, steel fixers etc..

   When a building site finished, the process of negotiating new pay and
   conditions started all over again on the next one. The construction
   employers’ blacklist ensured that active trade unionists were not hired
   on new sites.

   The building workers trade unions formed a National Joint Council for
   the building industry. They agreed to submit a pay claim to the
   National Federation of Building Trades Employers for £30 per week and a
   basic 35-hour week for all trades.


   The employers rejected these demands and a national strike was called
   in May 1972. The trade unions decided that they would call out members
   first on the bigger and well-organised sites. These were in the main
   towns and cities such as London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and
   Newcastle.

   Some employers conceded the claim but the unions wanted to establish
   the principle that members throughout the country would be paid the
   same rate. An all-out strike was called in August and union members
   began to organise flying pickets to go to sites, usually in small towns
   and rural areas, which were still working. The flying picket proved to
   be a successful tactic. Instead of picketing sites where everyone had
   supported the strike and stopped working, union members decided to
   picket sites in smaller towns and other areas where support was not as
   strong. This proved to be very effective and the employers soon asked
   for further talks with the unions.

   On Tuesday 14th September 1972 the union side in the negotiations
   agreed a settlement with the employers. There would be an immediate
   increase in basic rates of pay of £6 per week for craftsmen and £5 per
   week for labourers. There was no reduction in the working week from 40
   hours though.

   This was the largest single pay increase ever negotiated in the
   building industry. It was a magnificent victory for trade union
   organisation, against all odds. The building trades employers, and
   their supporters in the Conservative Government, were shaken by this.
   One of the least well-organised groups of workers had taken on their
   employers and won.

   The Conservative Government and the employers did not let matters rest
   there…

the official campaign

   Please be aware that we are the official campaign. There are other
   organisations, mainly based in London, with websites who are purporting
   to represent the convicted pickets. We wish to confirm to you that our
   campaign committee, based in the North West, is the only body that is
   acting for and has the support of the pickets.
