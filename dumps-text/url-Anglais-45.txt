Strikes in sixth form colleges

   Tagged in
   Sixth form college

   National Education Union members working in 25 Sixth Form Colleges will
   be taking their second day of strike action on Tuesday 5 November to
   defend their pay, working conditions and employment.

   It is to the Government’s shame that cuts to 16-19 funding have been
   deeper and have gone on for longer than any other school sector. The
   Education Select Committee has said that funding per student fell by a
   full 16% in real terms between 2010–11 and 2018–19 – twice the fall in
   school funding (8%). There is currently an overall £700 million
   shortfall in funding for Post 16 Education.

   Teaching staff numbers and support staff posts have fallen
   significantly due to the real-terms cuts, while at the same time
   student numbers have risen. This weighs heavily on our members’
   workload and is putting the future of Sixth Form Colleges under serious
   threat. If the crisis continues to go unaddressed, it is students’
   education that will suffer.

   The NEU is arguing for the pay of Sixth Form College teachers and
   support staff to be restored to match that in schools, and for action
   on workload and job losses caused by underfunding.

   NEU members will be taking action to secure the funding needed to
   sustain fair pay, conditions and employment, including reversing job
   losses, class size increases, and cuts to teaching time and curriculum
   provision.

   Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education
   Union, said:

     “Sixth Form Colleges have always been a beacon of quality, but
     funding cuts have had a savage impact on pay, conditions and jobs
     and have driven far too many colleges towards merger or closure.

     “Strike action is always a last option but our members believe that
     it is necessary in order to solve our dispute and help save the
     sector and ensure future generations have the choice and opportunity
     for study that our local sixth form provides.

     “With a General Election on the 12 December we also want prospective
     parliamentary candidates to support our call for higher funding of
     our Sixth Form Colleges as a priority for their party.”

   Editor’s Note

   The NEU sixth form colleges ballot closed on 16 September and five out
   of six members voted to take action – 84% of members voted Yes to
   action and Yes to saving the sixth form sector. Overall, there was a
   43% turnout and there will be strike action in the 25 colleges that
   reached the 50% turnout threshold.
