Legal challenge against ‘strike-breaking’ law

   Eleven trade unions, coordinated by the TUC have begun legal
   proceedings to protect the right to strike. The unions – ASLEF, BFAWU,
   FDA, GMB, NEU, NUJ, POA, PCS, RMT, Unite and Usdaw – have taken the
   case against the government’s new regulations which allow agency
   workers to fill in for striking workers and break strikes. TUC
   affiliated unions UNISON and NASUWT are also launching separate
   individual legal cases against the government’s agency worker
   regulations. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The right to
   strike is a fundamental British liberty. But the government is
   attacking it in broad daylight.” She added: “Ministers failed to
   consult with unions, as the law requires. And restricting the freedom
   to strike is a breach of international law. That’s why unions are
   coming together to challenge this change in the courts.” The TUC has
   also made a complaint to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

TUC warning on dangerously lax labour laws

   The TUC has warned the government that another P&O style scandal is on
   the cards, unless ministers deliver stronger protections for workers.
   The warning came on 17 September, the six-month anniversary of the P&O
   scandal, which saw 800 seafarers illegally sacked without notice and
   consultation. The mass sacking is widely regarded as a nadir for the
   treatment of workers in recent years. TUC general secretary Frances
   O’Grady said: “Everyone deserves respect and dignity at work. But there
   are too many bad bosses in this country who treat their staff
   appallingly – and get away with it because of our lax labour laws.” She
   added: “Now is the time for government action on workers’ rights. Rogue
   employers need to know they can’t get away with treating staff like
   disposable labour. Let’s be clear. Without stronger protections for
   workers, another P&O style scandal is on the cards.”

   insecure work.


Furlough had ‘damaging’ impact on UK pilots

   Flight safety and the performance of pilots could have been adversely
   affected by the Covid-19 furlough, research supported by the UK pilots’
   union BALPA has found. The study carried out by Dr Simon Bennett,
   director of Leicester University’s Civil Safety and Security Unit, with
   the assistance of the BALPA, found that many felt their performance on
   return to work post-furlough was not satisfactory, and that morale
   across the industry had been impacted by inadequate government and
   employer actions. BALPA head of flight safety, Joji Waites, said: “It
   is clear that periods of inactivity and being away from the flight deck
   have a detrimental effect on pilot performance and we need stakeholders
   across the industry to really understand this and ensure that flight
   safety is always a number one priority.”
   BALPA news release, full study and summary.



Milk disruption continues over bad Muller rotas

   HGV drivers and shunters at Mullers’ Stonehouse factory in
   Gloucestershire are taking further strike action over imposed rota
   changes they say are detrimental to their quality of life. The change
   to a five days on, two days off rota system contravenes an agreement
   with Unite signed by the company earlier this year. Nearly 70 staff,
   responsible for delivering milk and other dairy products to M&S and
   Waitrose nationwide, had already taken nine days of strike action since
   25 August. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Muller’s knows
   very well that the new rotas will negatively impact our members’
   quality of life because it recently signed a deal with Unite ruling
   such changes out. So, Muller should step back from breaking that
   agreement. Our members have Unite’s full backing in the stand they are
   taking.”
   Unite news release.

Union concern at trade show harassment claims

   Stage and screen technical union Bectu has said it is dismayed at
   reports of sexual harassment and bullying at the Professional Lighting
   and Sound Association (PLASA) Show. Commenting after this year’s PLASA
   Show, held at Olympia London from 4-6 September, the union said
   “bullying and harassment is unacceptable in all its forms and Bectu
   will always work to stamp out this sort of behaviour, which has no
   place in our industry.” It added that it was “essential that PLASA Show
   and all industry events are safe spaces for our members and all
   creative workers. The mental toll sexual harassment and bullying has on
   its victims is devastating and it is critical that reports are properly
   investigated, victims supported and perpetrators held to account. We
   stand with the victims and call on PLASA Show to investigate these
   allegations.”
   Bectu news release.

Cornwall to cut vital fire service control operation

   The firefighters’ union FBU has said Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service
   should be ‘utterly ashamed’ at plans to scrap its entire control
   operation on money-saving grounds. The provision by firefighter control
   staff, who handle calls from the public, provide safety guidance and
   deploy resources during incidents, is set to end in April 2023.
   Instead, the calls would be handled by other emergency service control
   operations, but FBU said this has not been costed despite the move
   being mooted on money-saving grounds. Guy Herrington, FBU South West
   regional secretary, said: “Cornwall Council should be utterly ashamed
   of themselves for refusing to invest in a critical part of the service
   that ensure the safety of the public and firefighters, when they hold
   many millions of pounds in reserve.”
   FBU news release.

Payout for road injuries on the way to work

   A school administrator who was seriously injured when she was hit by a
   car on her way to work, has been compensated with the help of her
   union. UNISON member Michelle Miller, 49, was on her way to Kingsmead
   Primary School in Hackney, London, when she sustained multiple
   life-changing injuries – both physical and psychological – as a result
   being hit by a car being driven on the wrong side of road. The drive
   was subsequently convicted of dangerous driving. Lawyers brought in by
   UNISON to act in a compensation case secured a payout of over £287,000.

Compensation doubt for NHS Covid deaths

   The government payouts for families of NHS workers who died in the
   pandemic are to end. More than 700 bereaved families have so far
   received a £60,000 compensation payment following the death of a health
   or care worker from Covid-19. However, the Nursing Standard reports
   there are fears others could be left struggling following the closure
   of life assurance schemes across the UK. Dependents of nurses and other
   health and care workers who died from Covid-19 were able to claim the
   one-off lump sum under separate life assurance schemes in England,
   Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, the schemes have now
   closed, with just a one-year window for bereaved families to make
   claims. Death in service benefits are not affected.
   Nursing Standard.

Firefighters warn 100-hour weeks are ‘gamble with safety’

   Firefighters are taking second jobs and working up to 100 hours a week
   to make ends meet, leading to growing concerns that an increasingly
   exhausted workforce is resulting in a “gamble with public safety”.
   Firefighters across the country told the Observer that the service was
   at “breaking point” with more crew than ever being forced to take jobs
   such as personal trainers, painters and decorators or in warehouses.
   Wages in the fire service are often about £30,000 but can be as low as
   £23,000. Firefighters are being balloted by their union the FBU for
   what would be its first strike in nearly a decade.

Firm fined £200,000 after machine cleaning injury

   A company specialising in the manufacture of stabilisers and additives
   used in plastic products has been fined £200,000 after an employee
   suffered serious hand injuries while cleaning machinery. The employee
   of Mexichem Specialty Compounds Limited was cleaning the manufacturing
   line at the site in Chinley, Derbyshire on 21 February 2019 when he was
   injured. He was attempting to clean a rotary valve, standing with one
   foot on the machinery framework and the other on a ladder, when he
   slipped. As he tried to steady himself, his right hand went into the
   unguarded rotary valve resulting in a severed fingertip and lacerations
   to his hand. Mexichem Specialty Compounds Limited pleaded guilty to a
   criminal safety offence and was fined £200,000 plus £7,846.78 costs at
   Derby Magistrates Court.
   HSE news release.

Bosses failed to control risks from vibration

   Two partners in a construction firm have been fined for failing to
   adequately control the risk to its employees from exposure to
   vibration. Workers at Roywood Contractors were required to use
   vibrating tools without adequate control on construction sites. As a
   result, an employee who had been working at the company for 12 years
   suffered significant ill-health from hand-arm vibration syndrome
   (HAVS). An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found
   that on or before the 15 January 2020 the company failed to adequately
   assess the risk to employees from exposure to vibration. Andrew Hatto
   and Paul Kiff, trading as Roywood Contractors, pleaded guilty to two
   criminal breaches of the Control of Vibration Regulations 2005 and were
   each fined £1,150 and ordered to pay costs of £3,500 each.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS

Europe: Unions back ban on forced labour goods

   A new EU ban on good produced through forced labour is crucial to
   tackling the rise in the number of victims of modern slavery,
   Europe-wide trade union body ETUC has said. The European Commission has
   proposed a prohibition on products found to have been made using forced
   labour from sale in the EU, whether they are made in the EU or in third
   countries. The ETUC said it has been a driving force behind the
   proposal which will see EU member states required to establish and fund
   authorities tasked with tracking goods suspected of being produced
   through forced labour. To help detect and eradicate forced labour, the
   EU should also ensure the huge cuts to labour inspectorates over the
   last decade are reversed, the ETUC said.
   ETUC news release.

France: Authorities link asbestos to more cancers

   Some cancers of the larynx and ovaries are linked to exposure to
   asbestos, French health authorities have confirmed. Laryngeal and
   ovarian cancers are “under-reported and under-recognised” when they are
   linked to occupational exposure to this material, reported the National
   Health Security Agency (Anses). The move clears the way for better
   compensation for affected individuals, with Anses supporting the
   addition of both cancers to the list of occupational diseases
   officially recognised in France. This move would create a ‘presumption’
   the cancers are asbestos-related, rather than leaving it to the cancer
   sufferer to prove their condition is occupational.

Turkey: Children sickened is plastics recycling jobs

   Children as young as nine are working in plastic waste recycling
   centres in Turkey, putting them at risk of serious and lifelong health
   conditions, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).  In a new report,
   HRW accuses the Turkish government of exacerbating the health and
   environmental impact on the workers by failing to enforce laws that
   require strict licensing and regular inspections of recycling centres.
   Krista Shennum, Gruber fellow at HRW and the report’s lead researcher,
   said: “We call on the UK, the EU and other countries to manage their
   own waste domestically rather than exporting it to Turkey, where it is
   causing human health and human rights harms.” HRW interviewed 64 people
   in the southern Turkish city of Adana and Istanbul, including 26 who
   now work or have previously worked in plastic recycling facilities,
   found a third had either begun the work as children or were children
   when interviewed.

USA: Three fam deaths, but regulators are powerless

   The deaths of three people killed after being trapped in a grain silo
   in Pennsylvania will not be investigated because they died on a family
   farm. Andrew Beiler, 47, and his two sons - a 19-year-old and a
   14-year-old whose names were not released - died of asphyxiation from
   “silo gas.” One son was overcome by fumes, and his father and sibling
   attempted a rescue. All three were asphyxiated. There will be no
   official labour department investigation, because family members are
   excluded from Wage and Hour regulations and the safety regulator OSHA
   is not allowed to enforce safety standards on farms with 10 or fewer
   employees, or even set foot on the premises. “In other words, on farms,
   parents are allowed to kill their children, as long as it’s done in a
   work context,” said Jordan Barab, a former deputy director of OSHA.
