     Petition Withdraw the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill

   We want the Government to withdraw the Transport Strikes (Minimum
   Service Levels) Bill. We believe this legislation would unjustifiably
   restrict the right of workers to withdraw their labour, which is a
   fundamental human right.

   More details

   We are also concerned that the passage of this legislation could pave
   the way for "Minimum Service Levels" being imposed for teachers, refuse
   workers, nurses, and other workers?

   We believe the imposition of minimum service agreements will undermine
   workers and unions. We ask that the Government withdraw this Bill and
   not impose any other restrictions on rights to strike.
