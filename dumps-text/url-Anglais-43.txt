Spanish ports’ strike on pause

   Spain’s dockworkers unions called off the first two days of the 9-days
   strike scheduled for March, 6 and 8 and expect to continue negotiations
   with the government on the dock labour system reform. However, the
   action on March, 10 as well as those every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
   during the following two weeks are still scheduled.

   As we wrote earlier, on February, 24 the Spanish government unveiled a
   new law, thus initiating the dock labour system reform, for which EU
   has been pressing the country since late 2014. The Congress, the lower
   house of Spain’s Parliament, was due to vote on the measure this
   Thursday, however this was postponed until Thursday next week, March,
   16, in order to provide more time for opposing parliamentary groups to
   submit their opinions, as some political parties have already voiced
   their disapproval of the new law.

   The decision of the unions to suspend the commencement of the strike
   came as a result of this parliamentary opposition, which was seen as
   “opening a new opportunity for dialogue and negotiations”, according to
   Antolín Goya, leader of the main Spanish union, Coordinadora Estatal de
   Trabajadores del Mar (CETM).

   The Spanish unions’ move was supported by the International Dockworkers
   Council (IDC), which announced a series of measures arranged through
   its affiliates, the first of which was an international day of strike
   action in solidarity with Spanish dockworkers. This will be held on
   March 10, when European ports will stop work for three hours and ports
   in the rest of the world stop work for one hour. In addition, the ports
   in neighboring countries will not be used for the unloading of Spanish
   cargo while Spanish dockers are on strike. This involves Marseille-Fos
   (France), Lisbon (Portugal) and Tangier (Morocco). Portuguese unions
   will also call on dockers of Lisbon to ensure that no Spanish cargo is
   unloaded in the southern Portuguese port of Sines.

   “Furthermore, if this conflict is not resolved by the end of March, the
   IDC will investigate measures that will directly target Spanish foreign
   trade, both imports and exports,” the IDC said in its announcement
   published last week.

   The IDC has also demanded that the European Commissioner for Transport
   Violeta Bulc take “an official and unequivocal position on the Spanish
   government’s Decree Law”.

   However, Spanish sources comment that last week Violeta Bulc sent a
   letter to Spain’s Minister of Public Works and Transport, Iñigo de la
   Serna, confirming that the proposed reform complied with the
   requirements of the European Court of Justice and calling for its
   soonest ratification by the Congress. Furthermore, at yesterday’s joint
   session of the European Commission and the Ministry of Public Works and
   Transport in the Congress, Violeta Bulc once again confirmed: “The
   European Commission completely supports the new law. This is what we
   have expected for two years, since the Court of Justice’s judgement
   against Spain. Now, we believe that the reform will be approved prior
   to March, 24. If not, the European Commission will have to take
   subsequent measures”.
