Following the industrial action that took place in November, national negotiations are running till the end of January. We expect to know more and have a more comprehensive update in the new year.

October 2022

UCU, the University and College Union, have balloted and voted in favour of taking strike action over disputes over pay and working conditions, and pension cuts. Further information can be found on UCU&#39;s web pages about the strikes. Strike action will begin in November.

The ballots were aggregated, which means that for the first time in these disputes, all universities in that ballot will be hit by strike action, rather than individual institutions. Over 70,000 university staff at 150 universities could now strike after University and College Union (UCU) members overwhelmingly voted &#39;yes&#39; to strike action in two historic national ballots.

This continues to be a national issue, not just about Bristol, and any decisions on action will have been influenced by UCU&#39;s national position.

We are already speaking to senior staff members at the University about the strikes and are committed to the actions set out in our active policy on this issue to mitigate the impact on the educational experience of taught students, as well as supporting our staff who are striking.  

We’re aware that this will affect the university experience of many, and we also respect the right of university staff to pursue industrial action. In particular, our members who are PGR students may be taking part in the strike, and we will support them for the benefit of their careers in academia.  

We plan to give regular updates on the strikes and have answered a range of questions below.  You can also see an overview of action which took place in 21-22.

If you have concerns about how the strikes are affecting your education, you should contact your course rep who can bring this up at their Student-Staff Liaison Committee meetings, or with relevant staff members.


More info about the strikes

What is the strike about?

UCU members are currently involved in disputes over unsafe workloads, casualisation and equality failings, and USS pensions and pay. These issues are negotiated at a national level between representative bodies of Universities (e.g. UUK) and workers (e.g. UCU). Strikes are a legitimate tactic used by trade unions when they feel that the bodies they are negotiating with are not meeting their demands or making a reasonable compromise to resolve the issues they raise, and are generally seen as a last resort. 

On pay and working conditions, UCU argues that staff pay at Universities has dropped by over 25% in real-terms since 2009, meaning staff are being paid almost a quarter less than they would be if pay had kept pace with inflation (RPI) over this period. In addition, they argue staff’s working conditions have deteriorated, with increasing use of short-term, insecure or casual contracts which leave staff at risk, and excessive workloads which impact staff wellbeing. 

The ballot over pensions comes after employer body UUK voted to cut thousands of pounds from the retirement benefits of university staff, an action that most detrimentally affects members of university staff at the beginning of their careers. UCU believes the cuts were not necessary and can now be revoked.


When are the strike days?

Strike action has been confirmed as taking place on the following days:


	Thursday 24 November
	Friday 25 November
	Wednesday 30 November


Staff will also begin industrial action short of strike action from Wednesday 23 November, which includes working to rule, refusing to make up work lost as a result of strike action and refusing to cover for absent colleagues.


What is action short of a strike?

Action short of a strike means that staff will not be doing any work beyond what is required to fulfil their contract; this includes not working extra hours, not covering for absent colleagues, not rescheduling lectures or classes cancelled due to strike action and not undertaking any voluntary activities. 


Will all staff be on strike?

No, not all staff will be on strike. Some staff are members of other trade unions who have not secured a mandate to go on strike and so are not permitted to.  Lecturers do not have to notify the University before they go on strike so we cannot know exactly who will strike on any given day. In our experience, many lecturers will let you know if your teaching is going to be cancelled.

On Thursday 24 November and Wednesday 30 November, it is planned that members of UNISON (usually professional services staff) will also be on strike, so there may be greater levels of disruption.


What is a picket line?

A picket line is a boundary established by staff on strike, especially at the entrance to the place of work, which striking staff ask others not to cross. It is likely that you will see picket lines outside some University buildings on strikes days, with staff holding placards, handing out campaign materials and talking to students and staff about their cause. In our experience they are peaceful and friendly demonstrations, so please don’t feel like there is anything to be nervous about if you see them.


Can I get a refund from the University?

If you are thinking about making a complaint, we would encourage you to wait to see how the University responds to the impact of the strike first. This is so you can explain why the arrangements that have been made have not mitigated the impact on your studies.

If you are unsure about what arrangements have been put in place, you can contact your School Office, but please bear in mind that some mitigations will only be applied later in the year. You can see more guidance on how Universities are expected to respond here: https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/student-rights-and-welfare/student-guide-to-industrial-action/

If you do decide to make a complaint, the SU’s independent Academic advice service is on hand to help you. Our advisers can give you information about the complaint process and feedback on draft complaint forms.

The SU will also be working with the University to decide where with-held pay will be spent, as well as lobbying to ensure that it is spent in the interest of students. Officers will work towards increasing transparency with regard to the expenditure of with-held pay.


How will withheld pay be spent?

Bristol SU will be working with the University to decide where withheld pay will be spent, as well as lobbying to ensure that it is spent in the interest of students. Officers will work towards increasing transparency with regard to the expenditure of with-held pay.

Withheld pay from the 2021/22 industrial action was spent on a range of different areas to support students including:


	Reimbursing students for expenditure incurred as a result of industrial action 
	Library resources
	Increased study skills support
	Reducing costs related to physical activity (including Run series and &#39;Summer Six&#39; memberships)
	Funding to a 2 year project to improve the provision and impact of Academic Societies
	Community building events and support for international students
	Harm reduction work and resources





More info about what the SU is doing

Does Bristol SU support the strikes?

Yes, Bristol SU supports our striking lecturers and postgraduate students who teach.

We released the following statement on anti-marketisation as part of our work in supporting the strikes:

Bristol SU stands against the marketisation of higher education, and we recognise the key role that it plays in causing the issues that university staff are striking over, as well as many of the issues currently faced by students. 

In 2010, following the release of the Browne Report, the Government voted to raise the cap on tuition fees from £3,290 a year to £9,000 a year. This move has had a detrimental impact on the higher education sector, with universities forced further into competition, which has changed education from a right to a commodity.  

We recognise that the rise in tuition fees has not only negatively impacted higher education institutions themselves, but it has also greatly harmed the student experience. Students have been forced into the position of consumers, and sector-wide issues on the subjects of wellbeing, housing, and community building have grown in severity and complexity.  

Going forward, we will be using our voice as a member of the National Union of Students (NUS) and Russell Group SUs to amplify and bring further attention to the issue, and fight for a democratised, demarketised, and decolonised education. We will challenge the University on mitigating the local impact, through addressing the need to continue improving wellbeing support, challenging the unsustainable expansion of the institution, and supporting student-staff solidarity.  


How did Bristol SU come to this position?

In November 2021 we took a motion to Student Council to hear from elected representatives about how students feel about the upcoming industrial action and to make sure we put student needs at the heart of our response. 

Results of the vote on our student council motion show that students have voted to pass the motion, with amendments. You can view the amended motion here. This is now active policy for three years.


What can I do to support staff who are striking? 

A common way that you might be asked to show support to striking staff is to avoid “crossing picket lines” during the strike, e.g. by not attending teaching on strike days. The University advise that students who chose not to cross picket lines will need to take personal responsibility for the teaching and learning that they will be missing. We believe it is up to individual students to make up their minds about whether to cross picket lines, but will ensure that students are informed about this is as a way of supporting the strikes. 

Other ways that you can support striking staff are: 


	Join one of the picket lines, rallies or teach-outs led by UCU
	Like UCU Bristol on Facebook and attend any rallies or teach-outs that are advertised 
	Join UCU if you are a postgraduate student 
	Write to key decision-makers (e.g. the Vice Chancellor or UUK) highlighting your support for UCU’s demands and asking them to go back to the negotiating table 


As part of our policy on supporting Industrial Action, the SU will be making £175 available for students, in student-led initiatives, who choose to bolster University staff on the picket. 

If you would like to submit a bid, please contact: bristolsu-democracy@bristol.ac.uk 

UCU will be hosting picket lines on Thursday 24 November and Wednesday 30 November from 08:30am. On both days there will be a joint rally with members of UNISON outside the Victoria Rooms at 11:00.

More info about how the strikes might affect students

Will the strikes affect my lectures, seminars and tutorials?

Only some lectures, seminars and tutorials will be cancelled due to strike action. Striking staff do not need to notify the University before they go on strike, so it is not possible to know in advance which teaching will be affected. In our experience, many striking staff will choose to let students know in advance if they are going to go on strike. We will be working with our network of course reps to look for ways that we can help disseminate any information about cancelled teaching to affected students. 

The university have taken a position that where lectures are cancelled due to the strike, lecture recordings will not be made available without permission of the lecturer. This supports the right of staff to take industrial action.

The SU are working to mitigate the impact of the strikes on student’s educational experience. If you have concerns about how the strikes are affecting your education, please speak to your Course Representative.   


I am a student and I don’t want to cross the picket line. Where does that leave me?

Picket lines are likely to be peaceful and friendly. We know that UCU members appreciate the show of solidarity from students who choose not to cross the picket lines, e.g. by not attending teaching on strike days. If you do not cross the picket line, the University expects you to take personal responsibility for missed teaching and learning.  


Are university facilities, libraries and study spaces still open?

Yes, all University buildings are planned to be open as usual.


Will student services (e.g. the health service or careers) still be open and available?

Some student services staff may be members of UCU and on strike, but the services will generally remain open. If individual appointments are cancelled, you will usually receive an email to let you know in advance.


I am an international student - will the strikes affect my visa?

Your visa should not be affected by strikes. If your lecturers are on strike, you will be given an authorised absence with a note to say that your absence is due to strikes. If your lecturers are not on strike, attendance monitoring will continue as normal. We have asked the University to ensure they provide specific information to international students about the strikes, but if you have any questions please contact Student Visa Services at the University. 


I am a PhD student - will the strikes affect my viva?

If you have a viva that is scheduled for a strike day, the University should email you on an individual basis to let you know whether the viva will be taking place. You should assume that your viva will go ahead unless you hear otherwise.


I feel like the strikes are stressing me out and affecting my mental health. What can I do?

Make sure you take time to de-stress and talk about what&#39;s bothering you with those around you. The student counselling service have lots of tools for relaxation and stress management that you can find here.

You may also want to speak to someone within the University and you can find details of the support available here: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/wellbeing/.


I feel that I have been unfairly disadvantaged by the strikes - what can I do about this?

Bristol SU is working closely with University of Bristol staff to ensure that no student should be unfairly disadvantaged by the strike - for example, to make sure that students who have missed out on teaching can get changes or extensions to their assessments. If you feel that you have been unfairly impacted by the strikes, you can speak to one of our Academic Advice team who can advise you on how to tell the University about any extenuating circumstances, submit a complaint, or even appeal a final result.

To contact a member of the Bristol SU Academic Advice team, please email bristolsu-advice@bristol.ac.uk.

Student Expense Fund 

If you have experienced disruption due to the industrial action, you may be eligible to claim for out-of-pocket expenditure. 

Further details, including how to make a claim, can be found here. 



I still have questions

If you would like more information about how the strike action is affecting university services and who you can contact, please see the University&#39;s webpage.

If you would like more information on the pay dispute, please see UCU&#39;s web pages about the strikes. 

To contact a Bristol SU Officer to discuss the impact of the strike on students, please email your Undergraduate Education Officer, nicole.antoine.2017@bristol.ac.uk or your Postgraduate Education Officer, lu.macey@bristol.ac.uk. 

For further advice on what to do if the strikes are affecting your studies, please email bristolsu-advice@bristol.ac.uk. 

 

2021-22

The University and College Union (UCU) balloted in October 2021 on taking strike action or ‘action short of a strike’ over disputes over pay and the USS pension scheme.

The results of these ballots confirmed that University of Bristol academic staff and research postgraduates who teach, who are members of UCU, voted in favour of taking strike action in this academic year over pension disputes, and pay and conditions. 

Multiple periods of Industrial Action took place throughout the 2021-22 academic year, including Action Short of a Strike.

Your SU Officer team spoke to senior staff members at the University about the strikes and were committed to mitigating the impact on the educational experience of taught students, as well as supporting our staff who were striking.  

Your SU Officer team co-signed a letter alongside other Russell Group Students&#39; Unions lobbying for UUK (Universities UK) &amp;amp; UCEA (Universities and Colleges Employers Association) to enter formal negotiations with the UCU (University and College Union) and make meaningful progress that will see a long lasting solution to the industrial disputes that have severely impacted the experience of students for many years.

As part of the NUS New Vision for Education Campaign students walked out of university and gathered in central London on Wednesday 2 March for a student strike to demand education that is fully funded, accessible, democratised and lifelong. We supported a free coach for students from UoB and UWE to attend the event.

In November we took a motion to Student Council to hear from elected representatives about how students feel about the upcoming industrial action and to make sure we put student needs at the heart of our response. The policy to support UCU&#39;s industrial action was passed.

    <h1>UCU Strikes</h1>
  <div class="section default-body">
      <h3>December 2022</h3>

<p>Following the industrial action that took place in November, national negotiations are running till the end of January. We expect to know more and have a more comprehensive update in the new year.</p>

<h3>October&nbsp;2022</h3>

<p>UCU, the University and College Union, have balloted and voted in favour of&nbsp;taking strike action over disputes over pay and working conditions, and pension cuts. Further information can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/he2022">UCU's web pages</a> about the strikes. Strike action will begin in November.</p>

<p>The ballots were aggregated, which&nbsp;means that for the first time in these disputes,&nbsp;<strong>all universities</strong> in that ballot will be hit by strike action, rather than individual institutions.&nbsp;Over 70,000 university staff at 150 universities could now strike after University and College Union (UCU) members overwhelmingly voted 'yes' to strike action in two historic national ballots.</p>

<p>This continues to be&nbsp;a national issue, not just about Bristol, and any decisions on action will have been influenced by UCU's national position.</p>

<p>We are already speaking to senior staff members at the University about the strikes and are committed to the actions set out in our active policy on this issue&nbsp;to mitigate the impact on the educational experience of taught students, as well as supporting our staff who are striking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re aware that this will affect the university experience of many, and we also respect the right of university staff to pursue industrial action. In particular, our members who are PGR students may be taking part in the strike, and we will support them for the benefit of their careers in academia. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We plan to give regular updates on the strikes and have answered a range of questions below.&nbsp; You can also see an <a href="#2021-22">overview of action which took place in 21-22</a>.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about how the strikes are affecting your education, you should contact your course rep who can bring this up at their Student-Staff Liaison Committee meetings, or with relevant staff members.</p>

<div class="otpWrapper">
<h3>More info about the strikes</h3>

<details><summary>What is the strike about?</summary>

<p>UCU members are currently involved in disputes over unsafe workloads, casualisation and equality failings, and USS pensions and pay. These issues are negotiated at a national level between representative bodies of Universities (e.g. UUK) and workers (e.g. UCU). Strikes are a legitimate tactic used by trade unions when they feel that the bodies they are negotiating with are not meeting their demands or making a reasonable compromise to resolve the issues they raise, and are generally seen as a last resort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On pay and working conditions, UCU argues that staff pay at Universities has dropped by over 25% in real-terms since 2009, meaning staff are being paid almost a quarter less than they would be if pay had kept pace with inflation (RPI) over this period. In addition, they argue staff’s working conditions have deteriorated, with increasing use of short-term, insecure or casual contracts which leave staff at risk, and excessive workloads which impact staff wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ballot over pensions comes after employer body UUK voted to cut thousands of pounds from the retirement benefits of university staff, an action that most detrimentally affects members of university staff at the beginning of their careers. UCU believes the cuts were not necessary and can now be revoked.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>When are the strike days?</summary>

<p>Strike action has been confirmed as taking place on the following days:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thursday 24 November</li>
	<li>Friday 25 November</li>
	<li>Wednesday 30 November</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff will also begin industrial action short of strike action from Wednesday 23 November, which includes working to rule, refusing to make up work lost as a result of strike action and refusing to cover for absent colleagues.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What is action short of a strike?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">Action short of a strike means that staff will not be doing any work beyond what is required to fulfil their contract; this includes not working extra hours, not covering for absent colleagues, not rescheduling lectures or classes cancelled due to strike action and not undertaking any voluntary activities.&nbsp;</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>Will all staff be on strike?</summary>

<p>No, not all staff will be on strike. Some staff are members of other trade unions who have not secured a mandate to go on strike and so are not permitted to. &nbsp;Lecturers do not have to notify the University before they go on strike so we cannot know exactly who will strike on any given day. In our experience, many lecturers will let you know if your teaching is going to be cancelled.</p>

<p>On Thursday 24 November and Wednesday 30 November, it is planned that members of UNISON (usually professional services staff) will also be on strike, so there may be greater levels of disruption.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What is a picket line?</summary>

<p>A picket line is a boundary established by staff on strike, especially at the entrance to the place of work, which striking staff ask others not to cross. It is likely that you will see picket lines outside some University buildings on strikes days, with staff holding placards, handing out campaign materials and talking to students and staff about their cause. In our experience they are peaceful and friendly demonstrations, so please don’t feel like there is anything to be nervous about if you see them.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I get a refund from the University?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">If you are thinking about making a complaint, we would encourage you to wait to see how the University responds to the impact of the strike first. This is so you can explain why the arrangements that have been made have not mitigated the impact on your studies.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">If you are unsure about what arrangements have been put in place, you can contact your School Office, but please bear in mind that some mitigations will only be applied later in the year. You can see more guidance on how Universities are expected to respond here: </span><a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/student-rights-and-welfare/student-guide-to-industrial-action/"><span style="color:null;">https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/student-rights-and-welfare/student-guide-to-industrial-action/</span></a></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">If you do decide to make a complaint, the SU’s independent Academic advice service&nbsp;is on hand to help you. Our advisers can give you information about the complaint process and feedback on draft complaint forms.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">The SU will also be working with the University to decide where with-held pay will be spent, as well as lobbying to ensure that it is spent in the interest of students. Officers will work towards increasing transparency with regard&nbsp;to the expenditure of with-held pay.</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>How will withheld pay be spent?</summary>

<p>Bristol SU will be working with the University to decide where withheld pay will be spent, as well as lobbying to ensure that it is spent in the interest of students. Officers will work towards increasing transparency with regard&nbsp;to the expenditure of with-held pay.</p>

<p>Withheld pay from the 2021/22 industrial action was spent on a range of different areas to support students including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reimbursing students for expenditure incurred as a result of industrial action&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Library resources</li>
	<li>Increased study skills support</li>
	<li>Reducing costs related to physical activity (including Run series and 'Summer Six' memberships)</li>
	<li>Funding to&nbsp;a 2 year project to improve the provision and impact of Academic Societies</li>
	<li>Community building events and support for international students</li>
	<li>Harm reduction work and resources</li>
</ul>

<h3>More info about what the SU is doing</h3>

<details><summary>Does Bristol SU support the strikes?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">Yes, Bristol SU supports our striking lecturers and postgraduate students who teach.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">We released the following statement on anti-marketisation as part of our work in supporting the strikes:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">Bristol SU stands against the marketisation of higher education, and we recognise the key role that it plays in causing the issues that university staff are striking over, as well as many of the issues currently faced by students.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">In 2010, following the release of the Browne Report, the Government voted to raise the cap on tuition fees from £3,290 a year to £9,000 a year. This move has had a detrimental impact on the higher education sector, with universities forced further into competition, which has changed education from a right to a commodity. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">We recognise that the rise in tuition fees has not only negatively impacted higher education institutions themselves, but it has also greatly harmed the student experience. Students have been forced into the position of consumers, and sector-wide issues on the subjects of wellbeing, housing, and community building have grown in severity and complexity. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">Going forward, we will be using our voice as a member of the National Union of Students (NUS) and Russell Group SUs to amplify and bring further attention to the issue, and fight for a democratised, demarketised, and decolonised education. We will challenge the University on mitigating the local impact, through addressing the need to continue improving wellbeing support, challenging the unsustainable expansion of the institution, and supporting student-staff solidarity. &nbsp;</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>How did Bristol SU come to this position?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">In November 2021 we took a motion to Student Council to hear from elected representatives about how students feel about the upcoming industrial action and to make sure we put student needs at the heart of our response.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">Results of the vote on our student council motion show that students have voted to pass the motion, with amendments. You can&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nusdigital.s3.amazonaws.com/document/documents/97413/0c6a7b25fea929a882b25b898f36ad5b/Amended_Bristol_SUs_Response_to_University_Industrial_Action_Final_Draft_6.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:null;">view the amended motion here</span></a><span style="color:null;">. This is now active policy for three years.</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>What can I do to support staff who are striking?&nbsp;</summary>

<p>A common way that you might be asked to show support to striking staff is to avoid “crossing picket lines” during the strike, e.g. by not attending teaching on strike days. The University advise that students who chose not to cross picket lines will need to take personal responsibility for the teaching and learning that they will be missing. We believe it is up to individual students to make up their minds about whether to cross picket lines, but will ensure that students are informed about this is as a way of supporting the strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other ways that you can support striking staff are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Join <a href="https://bristolucu.wordpress.com/2022/11/16/bristol-ucu-picket-lines-thursday-24th-november-from-0830/" target="_blank">one of the picket lines</a>, rallies or teach-outs led by UCU</li>
	<li>Like UCU Bristol on Facebook and attend any rallies or teach-outs that are advertised&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Join UCU if you are a postgraduate student&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Write to key decision-makers (e.g. the Vice Chancellor or UUK) highlighting your support for UCU’s demands and asking them to go back to the negotiating table&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of our policy on supporting Industrial Action, the SU will be making £175 available for students, in student-led initiatives, who choose to bolster University staff on the picket.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>More info about how the strikes might affect students</h3>

<details><summary>Will the strikes affect my lectures, seminars and tutorials?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">Only some lectures, seminars and tutorials will be cancelled due to strike action. Striking staff do not need to notify the University before they go on strike, so it is not possible to know in advance which teaching will be affected. In our experience, many striking staff will choose to let students know in advance if they are going to go on strike. We will be working with our network of course reps to look for ways that we can help disseminate any information about cancelled teaching to affected students.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">The university have taken a position that where lectures are cancelled due to the strike, lecture recordings will not be made available without permission of the lecturer. This supports the right of staff to take industrial action.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:null;">The SU are working to mitigate the impact of the strikes on&nbsp;student’s&nbsp;educational experience. If you have concerns&nbsp;about how the strikes are affecting your education, please speak to your&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/course_rep" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:null;">Course Representative</span></a><span style="color:null;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>I am a student and I don’t want to cross the picket line. Where does that leave me?</summary>

<p>Picket lines are likely to be peaceful and friendly. We know that UCU members appreciate the show of solidarity from students who choose not to cross the picket lines, e.g. by not attending teaching on strike days.&nbsp;If you do not cross the picket line, the University expects you to take personal responsibility for missed teaching and learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Are university facilities, libraries and study spaces still open?</summary>

<p>Yes, all University buildings are planned to be open as usual.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Will student services (e.g. the health service or careers) still be open and available?</summary>

<p>Some student services staff may be members of UCU and on strike,&nbsp;but the services will generally remain open. If individual appointments are cancelled, you will usually receive an email to let you know in advance.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>I am an international student - will the strikes affect my visa?</summary>

<p>Your visa should not be affected by strikes. If your lecturers are on strike, you will be given an authorised absence with a note to say that your absence is due to strikes. If your lecturers are not on strike, attendance monitoring will continue as normal. We have asked the University to ensure they provide specific information to international students about the strikes, but if you have any questions please <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/" target="_blank">contact Student Visa Services at the University</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</details>

<details><summary>I am a PhD student - will the strikes affect my viva?</summary>

<p><span style="color:null;">If you have a viva that is scheduled for a strike day, the University should email you on an individual basis to let you know whether the viva will be taking place. You should assume that your viva will go ahead unless you hear otherwise.</span></p>
</details>

<details><summary>I feel like the strikes are stressing me out and affecting my mental health. What can I do?</summary>

<p>Make sure you take time to de-stress and talk about what's bothering you with those around you. The student counselling service have lots of <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/student-counselling/self-help/relaxation/">tools for relaxation and stress management that you can find here.</a></p>

<details><summary>I feel that I have been unfairly disadvantaged by the strikes - what can I do about this?</summary>

<p>Bristol SU is working closely with University of Bristol staff to ensure that no student should be unfairly disadvantaged by the strike - for example, to make sure that students who have missed out on teaching can get changes or extensions to their assessments. If you feel that you have been unfairly impacted by the strikes, you can speak to one of our Academic Advice team who can advise you on how to tell the University about any extenuating circumstances, submit a complaint, or even appeal a final result.</p>

<p>To contact a member of the Bristol SU Academic Advice team, please email <a href="mailto:bristolsu-justask@bristol.ac.uk">bristolsu-advice@bristol.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The University and College Union (UCU) balloted in October 2021 on taking strike action or ‘action short of a strike’ over disputes over pay and the USS pension scheme.</p>

<p>The results of these ballots confirmed that University of Bristol academic staff and research postgraduates who teach, who are members of UCU,&nbsp;voted in favour of taking strike action in this academic year over pension disputes, and pay and conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple periods of Industrial Action took place throughout the 2021-22 academic year, including Action Short of a Strike.</p>

<p>Your SU Officer team spoke to senior staff members at the University about the strikes and were committed to mitigating the impact on the educational experience of taught students, as well as supporting our staff who were striking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Your SU Officer team co-signed a letter alongside other Russell Group Students' Unions lobbying for UUK (Universities UK) &amp; UCEA (Universities and Colleges Employers Association) to enter formal negotiations with the UCU (University and College Union) and make meaningful progress that will see a long lasting solution to the industrial disputes that have severely impacted the experience of students for many years.</p>

<p>As part of the NUS New Vision for Education Campaign students walked out of university and gathered in central London on Wednesday 2 March for a student strike to demand education that is fully funded, accessible, democratised and lifelong. We supported a free coach for students from UoB and UWE to attend the event.</p>

<p>In November we took a motion to Student Council to hear from elected representatives about how students feel about the upcoming industrial action and to make sure we put student needs at the heart of our response. The policy to support UCU's industrial action was passed.</p>
